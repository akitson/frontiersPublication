The visual stimulus was provided by a 3-m diameter sphere with random dots rotating at 30, 45, and 60° per second about the stationary S's roll, pitch, and yaw axes. The S's head was positioned at the center of the sphere such that it experienced apparent motion in all 3 axes. In the normal group, symptoms of motion sickness were reported in 21 of 27 trials. When labyrinthine-defective Ss were exposed to the roll and pitch stimulus, no sickness symptoms were reported or observed. Results suggest that the vestibular system is necessary for sickness induced by moving visual fields.},

	abstract = {Assessed the ability of sighted, blindfolded adults to navigate while walking in 2 types of tasks, one requiring knowledge of a route that previously had been navigated and another requiring more complex spatial inference or computation. The route tasks included maintenance of a heading, distance and turn reproduction and estimation, and turn production. The inferential task required completion of a multisegment pathway by returning directly to the origin. Measures for the route-knowledge tasks indicated a substantial ability to navigate in the absence of visual cues. Route reproduction performance was particularly accurate despite intrinsic veering tendencies. A substantial increase in error was observed in the pattern-completion task. The completion task led to a high correlation between absolute turn and distance error but had minimal correlations with the route tasks.

Cunningham is a strongly committed as ever to the discovery of new ways of moving and of making movement, refusing to be hampered by the physical limitations that have come with age. Since 1991 every new work has been made at least in part with the use of the computer program Life Forms, which enables him to devise choreographic phrases that he himself would be unable to perform - and which challenge and develop the virtuosity of the young dancers in his {company.The} essays collected in this special issue of Choreography and Dance were written over the last few years and discuss various aspects of the work of Cunningham as seen both from the outside and the inside.},

	abstract = {Visually induced linear motion sensation (linear vection) was obtained by projection of a visual scene moving linearly in a sagittal plane at the periphery of the visual field of healthy subjects standing erect on a force platform. This linear vection induces postural readjustments characterized by an inclination of the subject, in the same direction as the movement of the visual scene, followed by an after-effect. The amplitude of the postural changes was: a) logarithmically proportional to the image velocity and the density (or the spatial frequency) of the image pattern, at highest image velocities there was a saturation of the postural effect due to limits in image motion perception and not to biomechanical constraints; b) dependent appreciably on the size of the moving scene and its relative location (in the visual field). The frequency analysis of postural readjustments showed a) an increase of the amplitude of postural sway, especially at the low frequencies (from 0.02–0.2 Hz); b) sharp peaks in the power spectrum located between 0.15 and 0.5 Hz. From the dynamic relationships between the velocity of the moving visual scene and the amplitude of sway, it was concluded that the postural readjustment is proportional to a low pass filtering of the logarithm of the velocity. The contribution of Tibialis Anterior and Soleus was to oppose the body inclination with a resistive force. These results are analyzed in regard to the current theories concerning visual, vestibular and preceptive interaction in postural mechanisms.},

	title = {Circular vection is facilitated by a consistent photorealistic scene},
	abstract = {It is well known that large visual stimuli that move in a uniform manner can induce illusory sensations of self-motion in stationary observers. This perceptual phenomenon is commonly referred to as vection. The prevailing notion of vection is that the illusion arises from bottom-up perceptual processes and that it mainly depends on physical parameters of the visual stimulus (e.g., contrast, spatial frequency etc.). In our study, we investigated whether vection can also be influenced by top-down processes: We tested whether a photorealistic image of a real scene that contains consistent spatial information about pictorial depth and scene layout (e.g., linear perspective, relative size, texture gradients etc.) can induce vection more easily than a comparable stimulus with the same image statistics where information about relative depth and scene layout has been removed. This was done by randomly shuffling image parts in a mosaic-like manner. The underlying idea is that the consistent photorealistic scene might facilitate vection by providing the observers with a convincing mental reference frame for the simulated environment so that they can feel "spatially present" in that scene. That is, the better observers accept this virtual scene instead of their physical surrounding - i.e., the simulation setup - as the primary reference frame, the less conflict between the two competing reference frames should arise and therefore spatial presence and ego-motion perception in the virtual scene should be enhanced. In a psychophysical experiment with 18 observers, we measured vection onset times and convincingness ratings of sensed ego-rotations for both visual stimuli. Our results confirm the hypothesis that cognitive top-down processes can influence vection: On average,we found 50\% shorter vection onset times and 30\% higher convincingness ratings of vection for the consistent scene. This finding suggests that spatial presence and ego-motion perception are closely related to one another. The results are relevant both for the theory of ego-motion perception and for ego-motion simulation applications in Virtual Reality.

We describe a computational framework capturing this notion, and some specific models of integration and adaptation that result from it. Psychophysical results from two sensorimotor systems, subserving the integration and adaptation of visuo-auditory maps, and estimation of the state of the hand during arm movements, are presented and analyzed within this framework. These results suggest that: (1) Spatial information from visual and auditory systems is integrated so as to reduce the variance in localization. (2) The effects of a remapping in the relation between visual and auditory space can be predicted from a simple learning rule. (3) The temporal propagation of errors in estimating the hand's state is captured by a linear dynamic observer, providing evidence for the existence of an internal model which simulates the dynamic behavior of the arm.},

Twenty-four professional female artistic gymnasts (ranging from 7 to 20 years) and age-matched controls were seated on a motion platform and asked to discriminate the direction of angular (yaw, pitch, roll) and linear (leftward–rightward) motion. Gymnasts showed lower thresholds for the linear leftward–rightward motion. Interestingly, there was no difference for the angular motions. These results show that the outstanding self-motion abilities in artistic gymnasts are not related to an overall higher sensitivity in self-motion perception. With respect to vestibular processing, our results suggest that gymnastic expertise is exclusively linked to superior interpretation of otolith signals when no change in canal signals is present. In addition, thresholds were overall lower for the older (14–20 years) than for the younger (7–13 years) participants, indicating the maturation of vestibular sensitivity from childhood to adolescence.},

For this purpose, we set up a functional magnet resonance imaging experiment using verbal descriptions of spatial relations either with respect to the listener (egocentric) or without any body-centered relations (allocentric) to induce the two different spatial coding strategies. We aimed to identify and distinguish the neuroanatomical correlates of egocentric and allocentric spatial coding without any possible influences by visual stimulation. Results from sixteen participants show a general involvement of a bilateral fronto-parietal network associated with spatial information processing. Furthermore, the egocentric and allocentric conditions gave rise to activations in primary visual areas in both hemispheres. Moreover, data show separate neural circuits mediating different spatial coding strategies. While egocentric spatial coding mainly recruits the precuneus, allocentric coding of space activates a network comprising the right superior and inferior parietal lobe and the ventrolateral occipito-temporal cortex bilaterally. Furthermore, bilateral hippocampal involvement was observed during allocentric, but not during egocentric spatial processing. Our results demonstrate that the processing of egocentric spatial relations is mediated by medial superior–posterior areas, whereas allocentric spatial coding requires an additional involvement of right parietal cortex, the ventral visual stream and the hippocampal formation. These data suggest that a hierarchically organized processing system exists in which the egocentric spatial coding requires only a subsystem of the processing resources of the allocentric condition.},

In the study of the perception of three-dimensional structure from motion, the non-moving, passive observer in an environment of moving rigid objects has been used as a substitute for an active observer moving in an environment of stationary objects; this 'rigidity hypothesis' has played a central role in computational and experimental studies of structure from motion. Here we show that this is not an adequate substitution because active and passive observers can perceive three-dimensional structure differently, despite experiencing the same visual stimulus: active observers' perception of three-dimensional structure depends on extraretinal information about their own movements. The visual system thus treats objects that are stationary (in an allocentric, earth-fixed reference frame) differently from objects that are merely rigid. These results show that action makes an important contribution to depth perception, and argue for a revision of the rigidity hypothesis to incorporate the special case of stationary objects.},

This chapter begins by making formal distinctions between three kinds of representations: allocentric locational, egocentric locational, and allocentric heading representations. These distinctions are made in the context of whole-body navigation (as contrasted, e.g., with manipulation). They are made on the basis of primitive parameters specified by each representation, and the representational distinctions are further supported by work on brain mechanisms used for animal navigation. From the assumptions about primitives, further inferences are made as to the kind of information each representation potentially makes available. Empirical studies of how well people compute primitive and derived spatial parameters are briefly reviewed. Finally, the chapter addresses what representations humans may use for processing spatial information during physical and imagined movement, and work on imagined updating of spatial position is used to constrain the connectivity among representations.},

This article focuses on 3 questions about sex differences in spatial ability: (a) What is the magnitude of sex differences in spatial ability? (b) On which aspects of spatial ability are sex differences found? and (c) When, in the life span, are sex differences in spatial ability first detected? Implications for clarifying the linkage between sex differences in spatial ability and other differences between males and females are discussed. We use meta-analysis, a method for synthesizing empirical studies, to investigate these questions. Results of the meta-analysis suggest (a) that sex differences arise on some types of spatial ability but not others, (b) that large sex differences are found only on measures of mental rotation, (c) that smaller sex differences are found on measures of spatial perception, and (d) that, when sex differences are found, they can be detected across the life span.},

When instructed to use their nonpreferred reference frame, both groups displayed no decline in response accuracy relative to their preferred frame; even when presented with reaction formats based on either ego or allocentric coordinates, with format unpredictable on a trial, both groups responded highly accurately.

	abstract = {Recently, there has been an increasing interest in theories about human spatial memory and orientation (see, e.g., Burgess, 2006 for a recent review). There is, however, an apparent conflict between many of those theories that yet needs to be re-solved. Here, we outline a theoretical framework that aims at integrating two current theories of spatial orientation: May (2004) pro-posed that the difficulty of imagined perspective switches is caused, at least in part, by an interference between the sensori-motor and the to-be-imagined perspectives. Riecke \& von der Heyde (2002) developed a theoretical framework that is based on a network of logical propositions (i.e., necessary and sufficient conditions). They proposed that automatic spatial updating can only occur if there is a consistency between the observer's concurrent egocentric reference frames (e.g., mediated by real world perception, virtual reality {\{VR\}}, or imagined perspectives). We propose that the underlying processes are the same, in the sense that a consistency between egocentric representations (Riecke {\textbackslash}\& von der Heyde, 2002) is equivalent to an absence of interference (May, 2004). Whenever the current egocentric representations of the immediate surroundings are consistent, there should be no interference. According to Riecke {\textbackslash}\& von der Heyde (2002), this state enables automatic spatial updating. We propose that this lack of interference might also be able to explain other important phenomena, such as the relative ease of adopting a new perspective after being disoriented. Con-versely, interference (inconsistency) between the primary, embodied egocentric representation and a to-be-imagined (e.g., experimentally instructed) egocentric representation implies the difficulty of adopting a new perspective. We posit that such interference or inconsistency also explains the difficulty people have in ignoring bodily rotations. To avoid the vagueness that purely verbally defined theories sometimes suffer from, we offer a well-defined graphical and structural representation of our framework. Integrating logical and information flow representations in one coherent frame-work not only provides a unified representation of previously seemingly isolated findings and theories, but also fosters a deeper understanding of the underlying processes and enables clear, testable predictions. 1 Burgess, N.

When post- discomfort was compared to a pre-baseline, the participants reported more sickness afterward (p{\textless}0.03). The change in felt limb position resulted in subjects pointing higher (p{\textless}0.038) and slightly to the left, although the latter difference was not statistically significant (p=0.08). When findings from a second study using a different {VE} system were compared, they essentially replicated the results of the first study with higher sickness afterward (p{\textless}0.001) and post- pointing errors were also up (p{\textless}0.001) and to the left (p{\textless}0.001). While alternative explanations (e.g. learning, fatigue, boredom, habituation, etc.) of these outcomes cannot be ruled out, the consistency of the post- effects on felt limb position changes in the two {VE} implies that these recalibrations may linger once interaction with the {VE} has concluded, rendering users potentially physiologically maladapted for the real world when they return. This suggests there may be safety concerns following {VE} exposures until pre-exposure functioning has been regained. The results of this study emphasize the need for developing and using objective measures of post-{VE} exposure aftereffects in order to systematically determine under what conditions these effects may occur.},

A reduction of this conflict should, therefore, reduce the length of the latency period. In Experiment 1, visual-vestibular conflict was reduced by providing the observers with corroborating vestibular stimulation at the start of optokinetic stimulation. Onset latencies were found to be significantly shortened with corroborating vestibular stimulation, but to be unaffected by noncorroborating vestibular stimulation. In Experiment 2, testing was done on a group of patients with unilateral (right labyrinth) Ménière’s disease, which produces decreased vestibular sensitivity to rightward body rotation and increased vestibular sensitivity to leftward body rotation. Visual-vestibular conflict during subjective rotation to the right should therefore be decreased, while during leftward subjective rotation it should be increased. The prediction that the latency to steady-state subjective rotation should be shorter than normal with subjective rotation to the left was supported.},

A brief outline is given of the sensory rearrangement theory which seeks to define the essential nature of the nauseogenic stimulus. A wide range of provocative situations is classified as involving either a visual-inertial conflict, or a canal-otolith conflict or both. A number of behavioural measures by which the passenger can minimise the risk of motion sickness are described. Also considered are quantitative studies of vertical oscillatory motion, factors influencing motion sickness susceptibility (sex, age, exposure-history, receptivity and adpatability and personality characteristics), and the paper concludes with recommendations regarding the most effective use of anti-motion sickness drugs.},

This interactive system was designed to foster a meditative experience by facilitating users' sense of immersion while following a specific attentional pattern characteristic of mindfulness. The goal of Sonic Cradle is twofold: first, to trigger the proven effects of mindfulness on stress, and second, to help teach and demystify the concept of meditation for users' long-term benefit. This paper presents the design phase of the project, starting by theoretically grounding the initial concept. We then discuss 15 co-design sessions which provided informal conceptual validation and led to several concrete design iterations aimed at balancing users' perceived sense of control. The presented approach to designing an interactive stress management system can be considered research through design, as it also resulted in a novel theoretical framework for the psychology of media immersion which has implications for a wide range of research areas.},

	abstract = {Successful navigation through an environment requires precise monitoring of direction and distance traveled (”path integration” or ”dead reckoning”). Previous studies in blindfolded human subjects showed that velocity information arising from vestibular and somatosensory signals can be used to reproduce passive linear displacements. In these studies, visual information was excluded as sensory cue. Yet, in our everyday life, visual information is very important and usually dominates vestibular and somatosensory cues. In the present study, we investigated whether visual signals can be used to discriminate and reproduce simulated linear displacements. In a first set of experiments, subjects viewed two sequences of linear motion and were asked in a {2AFC} task to judge whether the travel distance in the second sequence was larger or shorter than in the first. Displacements in either movement sequence could be forward (f) or backward (b). Subjects were very accurate in discriminating travel distances. Average error was less than 3\% and did not depend on displacements being into the same (ff, bb) or opposite direction (fb, bf). In a second set of experiments, subjects had to reproduce a previously seen forward motion (passive condition), either in light or in darkness, i.e., with or without visual feedback. Passive displacements had different velocity profiles (constant, sinusoidal, complex) and speeds and were performed across a textured ground plane, a 2-D plane of dots or through a 3-D cloud of dots. With visual feedback, subjects reproduced distances accurately. Accuracy did not depend on the kind of velocity profile in the passive condition. Subjects tended to reproduce distance by replicating the velocity profile of the passive displacement. Finally, in the condition without visual feedback, subjects reproduced the shape of the velocity profile, but used much higher speeds, resulting in a substantial overshoot of travel distance. Our results show that visual, vestibular, and somatosensory signals are used for path integration, following a common strategy: the use of the velocity profile during self-motion.},

Here, we report changes in high-density {EEG} activity during a virtual tunnel passage task in which subjects respond to a postnavigation homing challenge in distinctly different ways—either compatible with a continued experience of the virtual environment from a solely egocentric perspective or as if also maintaining their original entrance orientation, indicating use of a parallel allocentric reference frame. By spatially filtering the {EEG} data using independent component analysis, we found that these two equal subject subgroups exhibited differences in {EEG} power spectral modulation during tunnel passages in only a few cortical areas. During tunnel turns, stronger alpha blocking occurred only in or near right primary visual cortex of subjects whose homing responses were compatible with continued use of an egocentric reference frame. In contrast, approaching and during tunnel turns, subjects who responded in a way compatible with use of an allocentric reference frame exhibited stronger alpha blocking of occipito-temporal, bilateral inferior parietal, and retrosplenial cortical areas, all areas implicated by hemodynamic imaging and neuropsychological observation in construction and maintenance of an allocentric reference frame. We conclude that in these subjects, stronger activation of retrosplenial and related cortical areas during turns support a continuous translation of egocentrically experienced visual flow into an allocentric model of their virtual position and movement.},

Gymnasts showed lower thresholds for the linear leftward–rightward motion. Interestingly, there was no difference for the angular motions. These results show that the outstanding self-motion abilities in artistic gymnasts are not related to an overall higher sensitivity in self-motion perception. With respect to vestibular processing, our results suggest that gymnastic expertise is exclusively linked to superior interpretation of otolith signals when no change in canal signals is present. In addition, thresholds were overall lower for the older (14–20 years) than for the younger (7–13 years) participants, indicating the maturation of vestibular sensitivity from childhood to adolescence.},

	abstract = {Abstract Spatial cognitive processes can be based on distinct reference frames centered on the body (egocentric reference frame) or centered on aspects of the surrounding environment independent of the position and orientation of the cognizing subject (allocentric reference frame). Updating of spatial information based on an egocentric reference frame is often believed to be highly automatic while the computation of spatial information based on an allocentric reference frame is assumed to be effortful and dependent on prior egocentric space processing. In this position paper I will review theoretical and empirical work that challenges the view of such a hierarchical organization of spatial reference frames and propose an embodied view of spatial reference frame computation. This perspective is based on three interdependent aspects of spatial reference frames. First, based on the existence of neural structures that allow for an automatic computation of both, egocentric and allocentric spatial representations, a functional equivalence of distinct reference frames is proposed. Second, based on the assumption of efficient computation and parallel accessibility of distinct reference frames individual proclivities are proposed to develop based on environmental and socio-cultural influences. Finally, it is proposed that ontogenetic differences are manifest in anatomical changes associated with the dominant use of different reference frames. These changes influence the microgenesis of spatial knowledge and influence behavior in other spatial cognitive tasks. In conclusion, an embodied framework of spatial reference frames strongly suggests consideration of individual reference frame proclivities to gain further insights into the complex architecture of human spatial cognition. More importantly, neuroscientific approaches describing cortical networks and associated brain dynamics have to allow participants to actively move and behave in their environment to allow for investigating the cognitive processes and brain dynamics underlying embodied spatial cognition.},

	abstract = {We attempted to distinguish walking on level ground from walking on a stairway using waist acceleration signals. A triaxial accelerometer was fixed to the subject's waist and the three acceleration signals were recorded by a portable data logger at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. Twenty healthy male subjects were asked to walk through a corridor and up and down a stairway as a single sequence, without any instruction. The data were analyzed using discrete wavelet transform. Walking patterns were classified in two stages. In the first stage, the times when the walking pattern changed were detected using the low-frequency component of the anteroposterior acceleration ({LFA)} and of the vertical acceleration ({LFV).} In the second stage, the three types of walking patterns were classified by comparing powers of wavelet coefficients in the vertical direction ({PWCV)} and in the anteroposterior direction ({RPWCA).} Changes in walking patterns could be detected by using either {LFA} or {LFV.} Walking down stairs could be distinguished from the other types of walking as it gave the largest value in {PWCV}, and walking up stairs could be discriminated from level walking using {RPWCA.} Level and stairway walking could be classified from continuous records of waist acceleration.},

	shorttitle = {Handbook of Virtual Environments},
	abstract = {This Handbook, with contributions from leading experts in the field, provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art account of virtual environments ({VE).} It serves as an invaluable source of reference for practitioners, researchers, and students in this rapidly evolving discipline. It also provides practitioners with a reference source to guide their development efforts and addresses technology concerns, as well as the social and business implications with which those associated with the technology are likely to grapple. While each chapter has a strong theoretical foundation, practical implications are derived and illustrated via the many tables and figures presented throughout the book.   The Handbook presents a systematic and extensive coverage of the primary areas of research and development within {VE} technology. It brings together a comprehensive set of contributed articles that address the principles required to define system requirements and design, build, evaluate, implement, and manage the effective use of {VE} applications. The contributors provide critical insights and principles associated with their given area of expertise to provide extensive scope and detail on {VE} technology.   After providing an introduction to {VE} technology, the Handbook organizes the body of knowledge into five main parts:  {*System} Requirements--specifies multimodal system requirements, including physiological characteristics that affect {VE} system design.  {*Design} Approaches and Implementation Strategies--addresses cognitive design strategies; identifies perceptual illusions that can be leveraged in {VE} design; discusses navigational issues, such as becoming lost within a virtual world; and provides insights into structured approaches to content design.  {*Health} and Safety Issues--covers direct physiological effects, signs, symptoms, neurophysiology and physiological correlates of motion sickness, perceptual and perceptual-motor adaptation, and social concerns.  {*Evaluation--addresses} {VE} usability engineering and ergonomics, human performance measurement in {VEs}, usage protocols; and provides means of measuring and managing visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular aftereffects, as well as measuring and engendering sense of presence.  {*Selected} Applications of Virtual Environments--provides a compendium of {VE} applications.   The Handbook closes with a brief review of the history of {VE} technology. The final chapter provides information on the {VE} profession, providing those interested with a number of sources to further their quest for the keys to developing the ultimate virtual world.},

A rapid pointing paradigm was used to assess automati℅bligatory spatial updating after visually displayed upright rotations with or without concomitant physical rotations using a motion platform. Visual stimuli displaying a natural, subject-known scene proved sufficient for enabling automatic and obligatory spatial updating, irrespective of concurrent physical motions. This challenges the prevailing notion that visual cues alone are insufficient for enabling such spatial updating of rotations, and that vestibular/proprioceptive cues are both required and sufficient. Displaying optic flow devoid of landmarks during the motion and pointing phase was insufficient for enabling automatic spatial updating, but could not be entirely ignored either. Interestingly, additional physical motion cues hardly improved performance, and were insufficient for affording automatic spatial updating. The results are discussed in the context of the mental transformation hypothesis and the sensorimotor interference hypothesis, which associates difficulties in imagined perspective switches to interference between the sensorimotor and cognitive (to-be-imagined) perspective.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the importance, if any, of the non-auditory labyrinth of the inner ear in visually induced nausea and self-vection in subjects exposed to a moving visual field with and without concomitant pitching head movements. Subjects teated were 15 normals, 18 unilateral labyrinthectomies and 6 bilateral labyrinthectomies. The findings show a higher incidence of pseudo-Coriolis induced nausea in normal subjects compared to unilateral and bilateral labyrinthectomized subjects. When the subjects were exposed to the moving visual field only (no head movement), pronounced self-vection occurred in all subjects, but with earlier onset in the bilateral labyrinthine defective subjects as compared to normal and unilateral defective subjects. The subjective intensities of self-vections reported by labyrinth-defectives were much more pronounced as compared to normal subjects, and it is apparent that visual input in these subjects achieves much more importance in maintaining compensatory eye movements, and the gain of neck reflexes is enhanced. The findings that visual stimulation is more effective in producing the disabling effects after labyrinthine destruction could possibly be explained by enhancement of vision after loss of labyrinthine sensory input, and the gain in neck reflexes is also enhanced after labyrinthectomy.},

	abstract = {This chapter summarizes a new theory of spatial memory. According to the theory, when people learn the locations of objects in a new environment, they interpret the spatial structure of that environment in terms of a spatial reference system. Our current conjecture is that a reference system intrinsic to the collection of objects is used. Intrinsic axes or directions are selected using egocentric (e.g., viewing perspective) and environmental (e.g., walls of the surrounding room) cues. The dominant cue is egocentric experience. The reference system selected at the first view is typically not updated with additional views or observer movement. However, if the first view is misaligned but a subsequent view is aligned with natural and salient axes in the environment, a new reference system is selected and the layout is reinterpreted in terms of this new reference system. The chapter also reviews evidence on the orientation dependence of spatial memories and recent results indicating that two representations may be formed when people learn a new environment; one preserves interobject spatial relations and the other comprises visual memories of experienced views.},

	abstract = {Results Circular motion of the entire surroundings (rotating drum) invariably leads to an apparent self-rotation (circularvection: {CV)}, which is indistinguishable from an actual chair rotation. Following stimulus onset, {CV} begins after a few seconds latency and slowly increases its apparent velocity until its saturation. {CV} may outlast the visual stimulus by as much as 30 sec. Latencies are independent of stimulus velocity. Even with drum accelerations up to 15°/sec2, stationary subjects cannot infer from the lack of vestibular input that only the drum is rotating. With stimulation of the entire visual field or sufficiently large parts of the peripheral retina, the velocity of apparent self-rotation matches stimulus speed up to 90–120°/sec. At higher speeds, {CV} velocity lags behind stimulus speed and results in additional egocentric motion perception. Masking the central visual field by black disks up to 120° in diameter scarcely diminishes {CV.} Conversely, if peripheral vision is precluded, stimulation of the central field up to 30° in diameter results in exclusive egocentric motion perception of the surround. With a central and peripheral stimulus equivalent in area, the peripheral stimulus predominates {CV.} Simultaneous presentation of conflicting central and peripheral optokinetic stimuli (i.e., stimuli rotating in opposite directions) has shown that exocentric orientation depends on the peripheral stimulus whereas optokinetic nystagmus and egocentric motion perception rely on the center of the visual field.},

To investigate the relative contribution of visual and vestibular cues to spatial updating, two experiments were performed in a high-end Virtual Reality system. Participants were seated on a motion platform and saw either the surrounding room or a photorealistic virtual model presented via head-mounted display or projection screen. After upright rotations, participants had to point “as accurately and quickly as possibl ” to previously learned targets that were outside of the current field of view ({FOV).} Spatial updating performance, quantified as response time, configuration error, and pointing error, was comparable in the real and virtual reality conditions when the {FOV} was matched. Two further results challenge the prevailing basic assumptions about spatial updating: First, automatic, reflexlike spatial updating occurred without any physical motion, i.e., visual information from a known scene alone can, indeed, be sufficient, especially for large {FOVs.} Second, continuous-motion information is not, in fact, mandatory for spatial updating---merely presenting static images of new orientations proved sufficient, which motivated our distinction between continuous and instant-based spatial updating.},

Their effect is considerable when located in the background of the moving stimuli but weak when appearing in the foreground.

Forty-six fasted subjects were assigned either to a meal group or to a no-meal group. Electrogastrographic ({EGG)} indices (normal 3 cpm activity and abnormal 4-9 cpm tachyarrhythmia) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia ({RSA)} were measured before and after a meal and during a subsequent exposure to a rotating drum in which illusory self-motion was induced. The results indicated that food intake enhanced cardiac parasympathetic tone ({RSA)} and increased gastric 3 cpm activity. Postprandial effects on motion sickness severity remain equivocal due to group differences in {RSA} baseline levels. During drum rotation, dysrhythmic activity of the stomach (tachyarrhythmia) and vagal withdrawal were observed. Furthermore, high levels of vagal tone prior to drum rotation predicted a low incidence of motion sickness symptoms, and were associated positively with gastric 3 cpm activity and negatively with tachyarrhythmia. These data suggest that enhanced levels of parasympathetic activity can alleviate motion sickness symptoms by suppressing, in part, its dysrhythmic gastric underpinnings.},

	abstract = {Background: The experience of spatial presence ({SP)}, i.e., the sense of being present in a virtual environment, emerges if an individual perceives himself as 1) if he were actually located (self-location) and 2) able to act in the virtual environment (possible actions). In this study, two main media factors (perspective and agency) were investigated while participants played a commercially available video game. Methods: The differences in {SP} experience and associated brain activation were compared between the conditions of game play in first person perspective ({1PP)} and third person perspective ({3PP)} as well as between agency, i.e., active navigation of the video game character (active), and non-agency, i.e., mere passive observation (passive). {SP} was assessed using standard questionnaires, and brain activation was measured using electroencephalography ({EEG)} and {sLORETA} source localisation (standard low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography). Results: Higher {SP} ratings were obtained in the {1PP} compared with the {3PP} condition and in the active compared with the passive condition. On a neural level, we observed in the {1PP} compared with the {3PP} condition significantly less alpha band power in the parietal, the occipital and the limbic cortex. In the active compared with the passive condition, we uncovered significantly more theta band power in frontal brain regions. Conclusion: We propose that manipulating the factors perspective and agency influences {SP} formation by either directly or indirectly modulating the ego-centric visual processing in a fronto-parietal network. The neuroscientific results are discussed in terms of the theoretical concepts of {SP.}},

Twenty-nine participants performed a spatial navigation task in a virtual maze and had to state their sensation of “being there” on a 5-point rating scale. Task-related power decrease/increase ({TRPD/TRPI)} in the Alpha band (8–12 Hz) and coherence analyses in different frequency bands were used to analyze the {EEG} data. The Single-Wall-{VR-system} caused a more intense presence experience than the Desktop-{VR-system.} This increased feeling of presence in the Single-Wall-{VR-condition} was accompanied by an increased parietal {TRPD} in the Alpha band, which is associated with cortical activation. The lower presence experience in the Desktop-{VR-group} was accompanied by a stronger functional connectivity between frontal and parietal brain regions indicating that the communication between these two brain areas is crucial for the presence experience. Hence, we found a positive relationship between presence and parietal brain activation and a negative relationship between presence and frontal brain activation in an interactive {VR-paradigm}, supporting the results of passive non-interactive {VR-studies.}},

	url = {http://www.kyb.mpg.de/publication.html?publ=5043},
	abstract = {While both biomechanical and moving auditory cues have been shown to elicit self-motion illusions ("circular vection"), their combined influence has never been investigated before. Here, we tested the influence of biomechanical vection (participants were seated stationary above a platform rotating at 60�/s and stepped along) and auditory vection (binaural recordings of two sound sources rotating at 60�/s) both in isolation and together. All participants reported biomechanical vection after a mean onset latency of 33.5s. Interestingly, even though auditory cues by themselves proved insufficient to induce vection in all but one participant, adding rotating sounds significantly enhanced biomechanical vection in all dependent measures: Vection onset times were decreased by 35\%, vection intensity was increased by 32\%, and participants had a stronger sensation of really rotating in the actual lab (28\% increase). In fact, participants were able to update their orientation in the lab in all but the pure auditory condition, suggesting that their mental representation was directly affected by the biomechanical and auditory cues - although perceived self-rotation velocities were typically below the stimulus velocities. Apart from its theoretical relevance, the current findings have important implications for applications in, e.g., entertainment and motion simulation: While spatialized sound seems not by itself sufficient to induce compelling self-motion illusions, it can clearly support and facilitate biomechanical vection and has earlier been shown to also facilitate visually induced circular vection (Riecke et al., 2005, 2008) and thus support information from other modalities. Furthermore, high-fidelity, headphone-based sound simulation is not only reliable and affordable, but also offers an amount of realism that is yet unachievable for visual simulations: While even the best existing visual display setups will hardly be confused with "seeing the real thing", headphone-based auralization can be virtually indistinguishable from listening to the real sound und thus can provide a true "virtual reality".},

Recent research suggests that problems can also result from conflicts between incompatible sensorimotor and cognitive object location codes during response specification and selection (interference hypothesis). Three experiments tested contrasting predictions of both accounts. Volunteers had to point to unseen object locations after imagined self-rotations and self-translations. Results revealed larger pointing latencies and errors for rotations as compared to translations, and monotic latency and error increases for both tasks as a function of the disparity of object directions between real and imagined perspective. Provision of advance information about the to-be-imagined perspective left both effects unchanged. These results, together with those from a systematic error analysis, deliver clear support for an interference account of imaginal perspective switches in remembered surroundings.},

Fifty years ago, it was proposed that we steer to a goal using optic flow, the pattern of motion at the eye that specifies the direction of locomotion. However, we might also simply walk in the perceived direction of a goal. These two hypotheses normally predict the same behavior, but we tested them in an immersive virtual environment by displacing the optic flow from the direction of walking, violating the laws of optics. We found that people walked in the visual direction of a lone target, but increasingly relied on optic flow as it was added to the display. The visual control law for steering toward a goal is a linear combination of these two variables weighted by the magnitude of flow, thereby allowing humans to have robust locomotor control under varying environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Brain oscillatory correlates of spatial navigation were investigated using blind source separation ({BSS)} and standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography ({sLORETA)} analyses of 62-channel {EEG} recordings. Twenty-five participants were instructed to navigate to distinct landmark buildings in a previously learned virtual reality town environment. Data from periods of navigation between landmarks were subject to {BSS} analyses to obtain source components. Two of these cortical sources were found to exhibit significant spectral power differences during navigation with respect to a resting eyes open condition and were subject to source localization using {sLORETA.} These two sources were localized as a right parietal component with gamma activation and a right medial-temporal–parietal component with activation in theta and gamma bandwidths. The parietal gamma activity was thought to reflect visuospatial processing associated with the task. The medial-temporal–parietal activity was thought to be more specific to the navigational processing, representing the integration of ego- and allo-centric representations of space required for successful navigation, suggesting theta and gamma oscillations may have a role in integrating information from parietal and medial-temporal regions. Theta activity on this medial-temporal–parietal source was positively correlated with more efficient navigation performance. Results are discussed in light of the depth and proposed closed field structure of the hippocampus and potential implications for scalp {EEG} data. The findings of the present study suggest that appropriate {BSS} methods are ideally suited to minimizing the effects of volume conduction in noninvasive recordings, allowing more accurate exploration of deep brain processes.},

	abstract = {Goal-directed self-motion through space is anything but a trivial task. What we take for granted in everyday life requires the complex interplay of different sensory and motor systems. On the sensory side most importantly a target of interest has to be localized relative to one's own position in space. On the motor side the most critical step in neural processing is to define and perform a movement towards the target as well as the avoidance of obstacles. Furthermore, the multisensory (visual, tactile and auditory) motion signals as induced by one's own movement have to be identified and differentiated from the real motion of visual, tactile or auditory objects in the outside world. In a number of experimental studies performed in recent years we and others have functionally characterized a subregion within monkey posterior parietal cortex ({PPC)} that appears to be well suited to contribute to such multisensory encoding of spatial and motion information. In this review I will summarize the most important experimental findings on the functional properties of this very region in monkey {PPC}, i.e. the ventral intraparietal area.},

	url = {http://www.kyb.mpg.de/publication.html?publ=2765},
	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:} Much of the work on self-motion perception and simulation has investigated the contribution of physical stimulus properties (so-called bottom-up factors). This paper provides an overview on recent experiments demonstrating that illusory self-motion perception can also benefit from top-down mechanisms, e.g. expectations, the interpretation and meaning associated with the stimulus, and the resulting spatial presence in the simulated envi-ronment. {METHODS:} Several {VR} setups were used as a means to independently control different sensory modali-ties, thus allowing for well-controlled and reproducible psychophysical experiments. Illusory self-motion perception (vection) was induced using rotating visual or binaural auditory stimuli, presented via a curved projection screen ({FOV:} 54x40.5\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$) or headphones, respectively. Additional vibrations, subsonic sound, or cognitive frameworks were applied in some trials. Vection was quantified in terms of onset time, intensity, and convincingness ratings. {RESULTS} \& {DISCUSSION:} Auditory vection studies showed that sound sources participants associated with sta-tionary acoustic landmarks (e.g., a fountain) can significantly increase the effectiveness of the self-motion illu-sion, as compared to sound sources that are typically associated to moving objects (like the sound of footsteps). A similar top-down effect was observed in a visual vection experiment: Showing a rotating naturalistic scene in {VR} improved vection considerably compared to scrambled versions of the same scene. Hence, the possibility to interpret the stimulus as a stationary reference frame seems to enhance the self-motion perception, which challenges the pre-vailing opinion that self-motion perception is primarily bottom-up driven. Even the mere knowledge that one might potentially be moved physically increased the convincingness of the self-motion illusion significantly, especially when additional vibrations supported the interpretation that one was really moving. {CONCLUSIONS:} Various top-down mechanisms were shown to increase the effectiveness of self-motion simulations in {VR}, even though they have received little attention in the literature up to now. Thus, we posit that a perceptually-oriented approach that combines both bottom-up and top-down factors will ultimately enable us to optimize self-motion simulations in terms of both effectiveness and costs.},

An adequate perception of self motion is important for movement, locomotion (Review in Schöne, 1980), and in any situation in which man has to drive a machine or a vehicle; it requires the evaluation of head motion in space which can be accomplished either by the visual or the vestibular systems. The case of angular rotation has been extensively investigated: the main features of the semi-circular canals, their dynamic properties and the effect of their stimulation (by angular acceleration) on perception or motor control are well known (see for some reviews: Baker and Berthoz, 1977; Wilson and Melvill Jones, 1979). The characteristics of visually induced circular self motion perception (circular vection), and the interaction between semi-circular canals and vision in self motion perception have been reviewed by Dichgans and Brandt (1978) and by Leibowitz et al.

Experiment 1 investigated whether auditory circular vection depends on participants' situational awareness of “movability,” that is, whether they sense/know that actual motion is possible or not. While previous studies often seated participants on movable chairs to suspend the disbelief of self-motion, it has never been investigated whether this does, in fact, facilitate auditory vection. To this end, 23 blindfolded participants were seated on a hammock chair with their feet either on solid ground (“movement impossible”) or suspended (“movement possible”) while listening to individualized binaural recordings of two sound sources rotating synchronously at 60°/s. Although participants never physically moved, situational awareness of movability facilitated auditory vection. Moreover, adding slight vibrations like the ones resulting from actual chair rotation increased the frequency and intensity of vection. Experiment 2 extended these findings and showed that nonindividualized binaural recordings were as effective in inducing auditory circular vection as individualized recordings. These results have important implications both for our theoretical understanding of self-motion perception and for the applied field of self-motion simulations, where vibrations, nonindividualized binaural sound, and the cognitive/perceptual framework of movability can typically be provided at minimal cost and effort.},

We hypothesised that stationary objects in the foreground facilitate vection because tbey introduce a relative-motion signal into what would otherwise be an absolute-motion siginal. Vection latency and magnitude were measured with a full-field moving display and with stationary objects of various sizes and at various positions in the visual field. The results confirmed the hypothesis. Vection latency was longer when there were no stationary objects in view than when stationary objects were in view. The effect of stationary objects was particularly evident at low stimulus velocities. At low velocities a small stationary point significantly increased vection magnitude in spite of the fact that, at higher stimulus velocities and with other stationary objects in view, fixation on a stationary point, if anything, reduced vection. Changing the position of the stationary objects in the field of view did not affect vection latencies or magnitudes.},

These were simulated as visual forward accelerations over a ground plane with people as size cues, presented together with brief forward surge translations and backward pitches of the platform, and synchronous random up--down movements of the camera in the visual scene and the platform. The magnitudes of all of the parameters were varied independently across trials. Even though variability between participants was high, the most believable simulation occurred when visual accelerations were combined with backward pitches of the platform, which changed the gravitoinertial vector direction approximately consistent with the visual acceleration. However, a wide range of platform pitches was accepted as believable. With high visual acceleration cues most participants reported trials as realistic even when the platform tilt rate was above vestibular canal thresholds reported in other works. Other manipulated parameters had only a mild influence on the responses. These results can be used to optimize motion-cueing algorithms for simulating linear accelerations in motion simulators.},

Here, two experiments investigated whether visually induced circular vection can be enhanced by concurrently rotating auditory cues that match visual landmarks (e.g., a fountain sound). Participants sat behind a curved projection screen displaying rotating panoramic renderings of a market place. Apart from a no-sound condition, headphone-based auditory stimuli consisted of mono sound, ambient sound, or low-/high-spatial resolution auralizations using generic head-related transfer functions ({HRTFs).} While merely adding nonrotating (mono or ambient) sound showed no effects, moving sound stimuli facilitated both vection and presence in the virtual environment. This spatialization benefit was maximal for a medium (20° × 15°) {FOV}, reduced for a larger (54° × 45°) {FOV} and unexpectedly absent for the smallest (10° × 7.5°) {FOV.} Increasing auralization spatial fidelity (from low, comparable to five-channel home theatre systems, to high, 5° resolution) provided no further benefit, suggesting a ceiling effect. In conclusion, both self-motion perception and presence can benefit from adding moving auditory stimuli. This has important implications both for multimodal cue integration theories and the applied challenge of building affordable yet effective motion simulators.},

	abstract = {When vision is excluded humans are still able to walk back to a starting point or to a previously seen target. This performance may be mediated by path integration, based on information about movement with respect to the ground or to inertial space, that is, on substratal or inertial idiothetic cues. We intend to unravel whether, and how accurately, these two inputs act and interact on the translatory component of this navigation performance. Subjects were asked 1) to reproduce a path they had walked, and 2) to indicate the location of a target they had seen before being blindfolded by (i) walking there, (ii) treading a motor-driven conveyor belt until they imagine they are there, and (iii) reporting, while being driven in a trolley, when they seem to pass the target. The estimation of path length turns out to vary as a function of walking velocity, step length, and step rate. The estimate becomes virtually veridical when subjects walk at their normal pace, but it overshoots at lower and undershoots at higher values of these variables. Veridicality at near normal speeds is also found with passive transport (iii), but with a reverse dependence on velocity. It is concluded that in these paradigms path control and perception are mediated by an open-loop performance of the underlying path integration system, calibrated in such a way as to yield veridical estimates during normal walking. Either inertial or substratal idiothetic information is sufficient for this performance. However, the quantitative relations found argue in favor of the hypothesis that substratal idiothetic information predominates when both are available. In spite of its limitations the capability shown here may serve as an essential constituent of navigation by path integration in humans.},

	abstract = {Large wall-sized displays are becoming prevalent. Although researchers have articulated qualitative benefits of group work on large displays, little work has been done to quantify the benefits for individual users. In this article we present four experiments comparing the performance of users working on a large projected wall display to that of users working on a standard desktop monitor. In these experiments, we held the visual angle constant by adjusting the viewing distance to each of the displays. Results from the first two experiments suggest that physically large displays, even when viewed at identical visual angles as smaller ones, help users perform better on mental rotation tasks. We show through the experiments how these results may be attributed, at least in part, to large displays immersing users within the problem space and biasing them into using more efficient cognitive strategies. In the latter two experiments, we extend these results, showing the presence of these effects with more complex tasks, such as {3D} navigation and mental map formation and memory. Results further show that the effects of physical display size are independent of other factors that may induce immersion, such as interactivity and mental aids within the virtual environments. We conclude with a general discussion of the findings and possibilities for future work.},

	volume = {28},
	abstract = {Large-field moving visual stimuli have long been known to be capable of inducing compelling illusions of self-motion (“vection”) in stationary observers. Traditionally, the origin of such visually induced self-motion illusions has been attributed to low-level, bottom-up perceptual processes without much cognitive/higher-level contribution. In the last years, however, this view has been challenged, and an increasing number of studies has investigated potential higher-level/cognitive contributions. This paper aims at providing a concise review and discussion of one of these aspects: Does the cognitive framework of whether or not actual movement is possible affect illusory self-motion? Despite a variety of different approaches, there is growing evidence that both cognitive and perceptual information indicating movability can facilitate self-motion perception, especially when combined. This has important implications for our understanding of cognitive/perceptual contributions to self-motion perception as well as the growing field of self-motion simulations and virtual reality, where the need for physical motion of the observer could be reduced by intelligent usage of cognitive/perceptual frameworks of movability.},

In contrast, previous studies of rhythmic hippocampal activity in primates under comparable behavioral conditions suggest it may be less apparent and possibly less prevalent, or even absent, compared with the rodent. We compared the relative presence of low-frequency oscillations in rats and humans during spatial navigation by using an oscillation detection algorithm ({“P-episode”} or {“BOSC”)} to better characterize their presence in microelectrode local field potential ({LFP)} recordings. This method quantifies the proportion of time the {LFP} exceeds both a power and cycle duration threshold at each frequency, characterizing the presence of (1) oscillatory activity compared with background noise, (2) the peak frequency of oscillatory activity, and (3) the duration of oscillatory activity. Results demonstrate that both humans and rodents have hippocampal rhythmic fluctuations lasting, on average, 2.75 and 4.3 cycles, respectively. Analyses further suggest that human hippocampal rhythmicity is centered around ∼3 Hz while that of rats is centered around ∼8 Hz. These results establish that low-frequency rhythms relevant to spatial navigation are present in both the rodent and human hippocampus, albeit with different properties under the behavioral conditions tested. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Vection (V) refers to the compelling visual illusion of self-motion experienced by stationary individuals when viewing moving visual surrounds. The phenomenon is of theoretical interest because of its relevance for understanding the neural basis of ordinary self-motion perception, and of practical importance because it is the experience that makes simulation, virtual reality displays, and entertainment devices more vicarious. This experiment was performed to address whether an optokinetically induced vection illusion exhibits monotonic and stable psychometric properties and whether individuals differ reliably in these (V) perceptions. Subjects were exposed to varying velocities of the circular vection ({CV)} display in an optokinetic ({OKN)} drum 2 meters in diameter in 5 one-hour daily sessions extending over a 1 week period. For grouped data, psychophysical scalings of velocity estimates showed that exponents in a Stevens' type power function were essentially linear (slope = 0.95) and largely stable over sessions. Latencies were slightly longer for the slowest and fastest induction stimuli, and the trend over sessions for average latency was longer as a function of practice implying time course adaptation effects. Test-retest reliabilities for individual slope and intercept measures were moderately strong (r = 0.45) and showed no evidence of superdiagonal form. This implies stability of the individual circularvection ({CV)} sensitivities. Because the individual {CV} scores were stable, reliabilities were improved by averaging 4 sessions in order to provide a stronger retest reliability (r = 0.80). Individual latency responses were highly reliable (r = 0.80). Mean {CV} latency and motion sickness symptoms were greater in males than in females. These individual differences in {CV} could be predictive of other outcomes, such as susceptibility to disorientation or motion sickness, and for {CNS} localization of visual-vestibular interactions in the experience of self-motion.},

Under normal terrestrial conditions, we feel virtually weightless and we do not perceive the actual forces associated with movement and support of our body. It is during exposure to unusual forces and patterns of sensory feedback during locomotion that computations and mechanisms underlying the ongoing calibration of our body dimensions and movements are revealed. This review discusses the normal mechanisms of our position sense and calibration of our kinaesthetic, visual and auditory sensory systems, and then explores the adaptations that take place to transient Coriolis forces generated during passive body rotation. The latter are very rapid adaptations that allow body movements to become accurate again, even in the absence of visual feedback. Muscle spindle activity interpreted in relation to motor commands and internally modeled reafference is an important component in permitting this adaptation. During voluntary rotary movements of the body, the central nervous system automatically compensates for the Coriolis forces generated by limb movements. This allows accurate control to be maintained without our perceiving the forces generated. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2010 {APA}, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Here, we demonstrate that cognitive (“top-down”) mechanisms like ecological relevance and presence evoked by a virtual environment can also enhance visually induced self-motion illusions (vection). In two experiments, naive observers were asked to rate presence and the onset, intensity, and convincingness of circular vection induced by different rotating visual stimuli presented on a curved projection screen ({FOV:} 54° × 45°). Globally consistent stimuli depicting a natural {3D} scene proved more effective in inducing vection and presence than inconsistent (scrambled) or unnatural (upside-down) stimuli with similar physical stimulus properties. Correlation analyses suggest a direct relationship between spatial presence and vection. We propose that the coherent pictorial depth cues and the spatial reference frame evoked by the naturalistic environment increased the believability of the visual stimulus, such that it was more easily accepted as a stable “scene” with respect to which visual motion is more likely to be judged as self-motion than object motion. This work extends our understanding of mechanisms underlying self-motion perception and might thus help to improve the effectiveness and believability of virtual reality applications.},

For vertical direction changes, 39\% of participants unexpectedly switched to their non-preferred (allocentric) reference frame. This might be explained by vertical (25°–90° up/downward pitched) trajectories having lower ecological validity and creating more pronounced visuo-vestibular conflicts, emphasizing individual differences in processing idiothetic, embodied sensory information.},

To test this idea visual-mechanical kinaesthetic conflicts were created by moving the visible surroundings linearly forward and backward around a passively or actively moving subject. In most cases vision dominated. Therefore vision is not a purely exteroceptive sense, nor is visual kinaesthesis simply an adjunct to mechanical kinaesthesis.

Improvements were also achieved by adding changingsize cues to sparse (but not dense) flow patterns. These findings showed that assumptions in the heading literature that stereoscopic cues facilitate self-motion only when the optic flow has ambiguous depth ordering do not apply to vection.

Since the vection onset latencies are presumed to be shortened by the decrease of the conflict between visual andvestibular afferents, the less-vestibular-sensitive subjects were hypothesised to have shorter vection onset latencies than the more-vestibular-sensitive ones.

A sample of nonmeditators ( N = 218) and meditators ( N = 243) with a wide range of meditation experience completed the Trait {TMS} and the six other mindfulness measures. Internal consistency reliability of the Trait {TMS} was comparable to that of the original State {TMS.} Significant positive correlations were found between both {TMS} factors and the other mindfulness measures; however, in general, the correlations for {TMS} Decenter were higher than for {TMS} Curiosity. Scores for {TMS} Decenter were shown to increase with meditation experience, but this was not the case for {TMS} Curiosity. The {TMS} Curiosity factor may assess a unique aspect of the mindfulness construct. Implications of these findings in relation to future mindfulness research are discussed.},

	abstract = {In general, vehicle motions far exceed the mechanical constraints of an earth-fixed simulator base. Inertial motions can, therefore, only be simulated in partial agreement with those of the actual vehicle. As a consequence, physical mismatches between inertial and environmental motion are inevitable. Here, the concept of a subjective reference frame is introduced, relative to which perceived self-motion is defined. This frame must be released from the earth-fixed frame to evoke simulated self-motion. In addition, self-motion and environmental motion need to be perceived reciprocal, in order to evoke a stationary perceived environment. Due to the only limited accuracy of human self-motion perception, however, perceived self-motion and perceived environmental motion need not to be exactly reciprocal. The extent to which self-motion and environmental motion may differ can be expressed by a just noticeable difference. This just noticeable difference denotes the threshold at which the environment is perceived to move. In this article, a self-motion perception model is outlined in which perceived environmental motion and perceived self-motion are separated. The perception model and the just noticeable differences can then be applied to determine the inertial stimulation that is needed to evoke perceived self-motion, in which the environment is perceived stationary throughout simulation.},

	abstract = {Vection is defined as the compelling sensation of illusory self-motion elicited by a moving sensory, usually visual, stimulus. This paper presents collected introspective data, user discomfort and perceived speed data for the experience of linear, circular, and curvilinear vection in a large-screen, immersive, virtual environment. As a first step we evaluated the effectiveness of a floor projection on the perception of vection for four trajectories: linear forward, linear backward, circular left, and circular right. The floor projection, which considerably extended the field of view, was found to significantly improve the introspective measures of linear, but not circular, vection experienced in a photo-realistic three-dimensional town. In a second study we investigated the differences between 12 different motion trajectories on the illusion of self-motion. In this study we found that linear translations to the left and right are perceived as the least convincing, while linear down is perceived as the most convincing of the linear trajectories. Second, we found that while linear forward vection is not perceived to be very convincing, curvilinear forward vection is reported to be as convincing as circular vection. In a third and final experiment we investigated the perceived speed for all different trajectories and acquired data based on simulator sickness questionnaires to compute a discomfort factor associated with each type of trajectory. Considering our experimental results, we offer suggestions for increasing the sense of self-motion in simulators and {VE} applications, specifically to increase the number of curvilinear trajectories (as opposed to linear ones) and, if possible, add floor projection in order to improve the illusory sense of self-motion.},

New studies have shown that place cells are part of a broader circuit for dynamic representation of self-location. A key component of this network is the entorhinal grid cells, which, by virtue of their tessellating firing fields, may provide the elements of a path integration–based neural map. Here we review how place cells and grid cells may form the basis for quantitative spatiotemporal representation of places, routes, and associated experiences during behavior and in memory. Because these cell types have some of the most conspicuous behavioral correlates among neurons in nonsensory cortical systems, and because their spatial firing structure reflects computations internally in the system, studies of entorhinal-hippocampal representations may offer considerable insight into general principles of cortical network dynamics.},

While the majority of studies have focused on the unimodal factors that influence motion perception (see, for example, the other chapters in this Special Issue), some researchers have also investigated the extent to which information presented in one sensory modality can affect the perception of motion for stimuli presented in another modality. Although early studies often gave rise to mixed results, the development of increasingly sophisticated psychophysical paradigms are now enabling researchers to determine the spatiotemporal constraints on multisensory interactions in the perception of motion. Recent findings indicate that these interactions stand over-and-above the multisensory interactions documented previously for static stimuli, such as the oft-cited ‘ventriloquism’ effect. Neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies are also beginning to elucidate the network of neural structures responsible for the processing of motion information in the different sensory modalities, an important first step that will ultimately lead to the determination of the neural substrates underlying these multisensory contributions to motion perception.},

The framework was structured around a binary decision tree in which movements were divided into classes and subclasses at different hierarchical levels. General distinctions between movements were applied in the top levels, and successively more detailed subclassifications were made in the lower levels of the tree. The structure was modular and flexible: parts of the tree could be reordered, pruned or extended, without the remainder of the tree being affected. This framework was used to develop a classifier to identify basic movements from the signals obtained from a single, waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer. The movements were first divided into activity and rest. The activities were classified as falls, walking, transition between postural orientations, or other movement. The postural orientations during rest were classified as sitting, standing or lying. In controlled laboratory studies in which 26 normal, healthy subjects carried out a set of basic movements, the sensitivity of every classification exceeded 87\%, and the specificity exceeded 94\%; the overall accuracy of the system, measured as the number of correct classifications across all levels of the hierarchy, was a sensitivity of 97.7\% and a specificity of 98.7\% over a data set of 1309 movements.},

Participant respiration decreased significantly in the pacing condition. Upon further analysis, we attribute this difference to a significant decrease in breath rate while the intermittent pacing feedback is active, rather than a persistent change in respiratory pattern.

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the vection in depth experienced by stationary observers viewing constant velocity radial flow can be enhanced by adding simulated viewpoint jitter/oscillation. This study examined the effect of manipulating visual-vestibular conflict on the perceived strength and speed of vection in depth. Four conditions were examined: (i) radial flow without viewpoint jitter viewed by stationary observers (consistent visual-vestibular inputs); (ii) radial flow with viewpoint jitter synchronized to lateral head oscillation (consistent inputs); (iii) radial flow with viewpoint jitter viewed by stationary observers (inconsistent inputs); (iv) radial flow without viewpoint jitter viewed during head oscillation (inconsistent inputs). We found that the strength and perceived speed of vection in depth was always greater when simulated viewpoint jitter was introduced. No further vection enhancement was found when this jitter was generated by active head oscillation--even though passive jitter conditions should have generated significant sensory conflicts, whereas active jitter conditions would not. Active head oscillation without display jitter also had little effect, producing similar vection strength/speed ratings to stationary observation of non-jittering optic flow. Horizontal eye tracking suggested that retinal stimulation was similar between comparable active and passive viewing conditions. This stabilization of the retinal image across active and passive conditions appeared to be due to cooperative engagement of the translational vestibuloocular reflex and the visually driven ocular following response. Rather than providing evidence for synergistic integration of self-motion perception, these findings obtained with low-frequency sensory stimuli suggest that self-motion perception is dominated by visual processing centres.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have reported that multiple brain regions are activated during spatial navigation, but it remains unclear how this activation is converted to motor commands for navigation. This study was aimed to investigate synchronization across different brain regions and between cortical areas and muscles during spatial navigation. This synchronization has been suggested to be essential for integrating activity in the multiple brain areas to support higher cognitive functions and for conversion of cortical activity to motor commands. In the present study, the subjects were required to sequentially trace ten checkpoints in a virtual town by manipulating a joystick and to perform this three times while electroencephalograms and electromyograms from the right arm were monitored. Time spent on the task in the third trial was significantly lesser than that in the first trial indicating an improvement in task performance. This repeated learning was associated with an increase in alpha power at the electrodes over the contralateral sensorimotor region and in theta power at the electrodes over the bilateral premotor and frontotemporal regions. Alpha- and theta-range corticocortical coherences between these regions and other brain areas were also increased in the third trial compared to the first trial. Furthermore, alpha- and theta-range corticomuscular coherence was significantly increased in the second and third trials compared to the first trial. These results suggest that alpha- and theta-range synchronous activity across multiple systems is essential for the integrated brain activity required in spatial navigation and for the conversion of this activity to motor commands.},

The reviewed studies provide evidence that auditorily-induced vection has behavioral, physiological and neural correlates. Although the sound contribution to self-motion perception appears to be weaker than the visual modality, specific acoustic cues appear to be instrumental for a number of domains including posture prosthesis, navigation in unusual gravitoinertial environments (in the air, in space, or underwater), non-visual navigation, and multisensory integration during self-motion. A number of open research questions are highlighted opening avenue for more active and systematic studies in this area.},

	abstract = {This dissertation explores the relationship between video game playing and performance on static and dynamic spatial tasks focusing on Tetris and first person shooter games ({FPS)} like Unreal Tournament 2004. An extensive meta-analysis of previous game research found that Tetris had the strongest effect for mental rotation of {2D} Tetris -like shapes (d = 0.82) and while {FPS} games were most effective on visual attention tasks (d = 1.13). Experiment 1 explores the relationship between 4 spatial skills and game performance in non-video game players. The study found significant correlations between Unreal Tournament 2004 performance and performance on all of the spatial tasks, while Tetris performance was only correlated with two of the tasks measures. Experiment 2 examined performance differences between action video game players ({VGPs)} and non-video game players ({NVGPs)} on the 4 spatial tasks as well as exploring processing differences on a {2D} mental rotation task during an electroencephalography ({EEG)} session. {VGPs} only significantly outperformed {NVGPs} on the interception task ( p {\textless} .001, d =.92), which has task demands very similar to the game mechanics for an {FPS} game. For the {2D} rotation task differences, the {ERP} waveforms showed a flatter profile for the 150 degree angle trials for {VGPs} compared to the {NVGPs} who showed the typical negative modulation around the P300 suggesting that {VGPs} might have used an alternative strategy for larger rotation angles. Experiment 3 examined the cognitive consequences of 10 hours of training with either Unreal Tournament 2004 ({UT)} or Tetris. Training with {UT} was not effective at improving performance on any of the spatial cognition tasks above the retest gains experienced by the control condition. The Tetris training group showed significant improvement on both response times for mental rotation ( p = .05) and interception task performance (p = .05). Comparisons of the {ERP} recordings on the {2D} rotation task between control and {UT} trainees showed no significant differences. Therefore, training with an {FPS} game did not affect how the spatial information was processed. Overall, the results from the meta-analysis and Experiments 2 and 3 argue for specific transfer theory when training spatial skills.},

As a result, a number of models proposing multiple systems of spatial memory have been recently formulated. In the present article we review these models and we evaluate their postulates based on available experimental evidence. Furthermore, we discuss how a multiple-system model can apply to situations in which people reason about their immediate surroundings or non-immediate environments by incorporating a model of sensorimotor facilitation/interference. This model draws heavily on previous accounts of sensorimotor interference and takes into account findings from the stimulus–response compatibility literature.},

	doi = {doi:10.1167/9.8.714},
	abstract = {While both biomechanical and moving auditory cues have been shown to elicit self-motion illusions (“circular vection”), their combined influence has never been investigated before. Here, we tested the influence of biomechanical vection (participants were seated stationary above a platform rotating at 60°/s and stepped along) and auditory vection (binaural recordings of two sound sources rotating at 60°/s) both in isolation and together. All participants reported biomechanical vection after a mean onset latency of 33.5s. Interestingly, even though auditory cues by themselves proved insufficient to induce vection in all but one participant, adding rotating sounds significantly enhanced biomechanical vection in all dependent measures: Vection onset times were decreased by 35\%, vection intensity was increased by 32\%, and participants had a stronger sensation of really rotating in the actual lab (28\% increase). In fact, participants were able to update their orientation in the lab in all but the pure auditory condition, suggesting that their mental representation was directly affected by the biomechanical and auditory cues – although perceived self-rotation velocities were typically below the stimulus velocities. Apart from its theoretical relevance, the current findings have important implications for applications in, e.g., entertainment and motion simulation: While spatialized sound seems not by itself sufficient to induce compelling self-motion illusions, it can clearly support and facilitate biomechanical vection and has earlier been shown to also facilitate visually induced circular vection (Riecke et al., 2005, 2008) and thus support information from other modalities. Furthermore, high-fidelity, headphone-based sound simulation is not only reliable and affordable, but also offers an amount of realism that is yet unachievable for visual simulations: While even the best existing visual display setups will hardly be confused with "seeing the real thing", headphone-based auralization can be virtually indistinguishable from listening to the real sound und thus can provide a true "virtual reality".},

Ten subjects completed two sessions, one with and one without feedback. Half of the subjects started with the feedback session and then completed the session without feedback; the other half had the reverse order. In the experimental procedure, subjects had to concentrate on their exhalation, being supported by respiratory feedback. In the background they heard slow movements of baroque music and relaxation-suggesting sentences. The control procedure contained only background music and relaxation-suggesting sentences. Both procedures elicited a trophotropic response: Finger temperature increased while skin conductance level, number of skin conductance responses, and muscle tension decreased. However, with respiratory feedback and meditation, there was an additional, specific effect, a decrease in respiration and heart rate, to an extent not found in the control procedure. It is suggested that exhalation feedback helps to concentrate on the exhalation process and by this means slows respiration rate, and as a consequence, also heart rate. Therefore, respiratory feedback could be a useful tool for inducing relaxation and slowing of heart rate.},

	url = {http://www.kyb.mpg.de/publication.html?publ=5071},
	abstract = {Current developments in creating the illusion of being in a virtual world ({VR} simulations) aim to increase detail and technical complexity to further realism and immersion for the observer. Consistent, multimedia sensor manipulation using audio, video and self motion is the key approach to increase immersion and thus, the feeling of "being there". Despite those technical efforts, achieving a high level of immersion and reducing the appearance of simulator sickness and disorientation in {VR} simulations still poses quite a challenge. Physical motion brings a certain amount of financial and implementational effort along (Platforms, Treadmills, etc.) and does not yield satisfactory results when taking the ratio of effort and results into account. Previous research show, that convincing self motion can be achieved using vection, the illusion of self motion (e.g., Riecke, Schulte-Pelkum, Caniard, \& B�lthoff, 2005a). Not having to use physical motion devices would bring us closer to our main goal of building a lean and elegant motion simulator. In pursuit of evoking convincing self motion illusion, we manipulated auditory and vibrotactile sensor channels to determine the effect of jitter and body suspension on auditory circular vection. We quantified experiences using intensity ratings, vection onset time, direction of perceived rotation and perceived rotational speed. We found, that purely auditory vection can be achieved with the setup we used. Participants were more likely to experience vection in either combination with jitter or the body suspended. Vection ratings were higher in either condition compared to pure auditory vection, where the participant's feet are on the ground and jitter is off. Furthermore, jitter in combination with a suspended body was more likely to produce auditory vection and yielded higher intensity ratings than all conditions mentioned in above. Suspending the participiant's body and adding jitter using a simple excenter motor enhances the self motion experience and thus brings us one step closer to designing a lean and elegant self motion simulator.},

In the current experiments, stereoscopic cues were also found to increase perceptions of vection speed and self-displacement during vection in depth -- but only when these cues were consistent with monocularly available information about self-motion. Stereoscopic information did not appear to be improving vection by increasing the perceived maximum extent of displays or by making displays appear more three-dimensional. Rather, it appeared that consistent patterns of stereoscopic optic flow provided extra, purely binocular information about vection speed, which resulted in faster/more compelling illusions of self-motion in depth.},

The vection-onset latency is thought to be shortened by the decrease of the conflict between visual and vestibular afferents. Since this sensory conflict can be presumed to be more important in the horizontal sagittal axis than in the vertical spinal one, the vection-onset latencies have been hypothesised to be longer in the former case than in the latter. Additionally, since the magnitude of this sensory conflict can be presumed to be the same between the two opposite directions within each axis, the vection-onset latencies have been expected not to vary between directions within each axis. The results confirm both these hypotheses.},

Using a circular treadmill, the proportions of the 2 sources of proprioceptive information were varied, creating walking conditions with a constant rate of biomechanical activity but with variable speeds of rotation relative to inertial space. The results reveal stable individual differences in sensitivity to information for the perception of locomotion.

	abstract = {The world is inherently meaningful for us, i.e. we perceive the world in terms of what we can do with it, and by physically interacting with it we access this meaning and express the meaning. We believe that this is the core reason and foundation for turning to movement-based interaction. {‘Interaction} creates meaning’ does not only hold for users during interaction but also for designers when generating ideas and developing concepts. Therefore, we postulate that if one truly likes to design for movement-based interaction, one has to be or become an expert in movement, not just theoretically, by imagination or on paper, but by doing and experiencing while designing. In order to do so, we believe that designers need design tools, techniques, knowledge, awareness and skills that support their search for expressive, rich behaviour. Our search for this support resulted in several methods, tools and knowledge that help designers exploring, visualising and reflecting on interactions. Our developed methods and tools such as the Design Movement approach with its choreography of interaction, gestural design tools, interactive installations and interactive tangible sketching, have not only supported and inspired designers to design for movement-based interaction, but also resulted in surprising, fresh designs in comparison with the limited scope of rather uniform and traditional electronic consumer products.

Three core aspects of dance were examined: entrainment, meter and patterned movement. Amateur dancers performed small-scale, cyclically repeated tango steps on an inclined surface to the beat of tango music, without visual guidance. Entrainment of dance steps to music, compared to self-pacing of movement, was supported by anterior cerebellar vermis. Movement to a regular, metric rhythm, compared to movement to an irregular rhythm, implicated the right putamen in the voluntary control of metric motion. Spatial navigation of leg movement during dance, when controlling for muscle contraction, activated the medial superior parietal lobule, reflecting proprioceptive and somatosensory contributions to spatial cognition in dance. Finally, additional cortical, subcortical and cerebellar regions were active at the systems level. Consistent with recent work on simpler, rhythmic, motor-sensory behaviors, these data reveal the interacting network of brain areas active during spatially patterned, bipedal, rhythmic movements that are integrated in dance.},

	abstract = {When we locomote through real or virtual environments, self-to-object relationships constantly change. Nevertheless, in real environments we effortlessly maintain an ongoing awareness of roughly where we are with respect to our immediate surrounds, even in the absence of any direct perceptual support (e.g., in darkness or with eyes closed). In virtual environments, however, we tend to get lost far more easily. Why is that? Research suggests that physical motion cues are critical in facilitating this “automatic spatial updating” of the self-to-surround relationships during perspective changes. However, allowing for full physical motion in {VR} is costly and often unfeasible. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that the mere illusion of self-motion (“circular vection”) can provide a similar benefit as actual self-motion: While blindfolded, participants were asked to imagine facing new perspectives in a well-learned room, and point to previously-learned objects. As expected, this task was difficult when participants could not physically rotate to the instructed perspective. Performance was significantly improved, however, when they perceived illusory self-rotation to the novel perspective (even though they did not physically move). This circular vection was induced by a combination of rotating sound fields (“auditory vection”) and biomechanical vection from stepping along a carrousel-like rotating floor platter. In summary, illusory self-motion was shown to indeed facilitate perspective switches and thus spatial orientation. These findings have important implications for both our understanding of human spatial cognition and the design of more effective yet affordable {VR} simulators. In fact, it might ultimately enable us to relax the need for physical motion in {VR} by intelligently utilizing self-motion illusions.},

	abstract = {Taking the first-person perspective ({1PP)} centered upon one's own body as opposed to the third-person perspective ({3PP)}, which enables us to take the viewpoint of someone else, is constitutive for human self-consciousness. At the underlying representational or cognitive level, these operations are processed in an egocentric reference frame, where locations are represented centered around another person's ({3PP)} or one's own perspective ({1PP).} To study {3PP} and {1PP}, both operating in egocentric frames, a virtual scene with an avatar and red balls in a room was presented from different camera viewpoints to normal volunteers (n = 11) in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. The task for the subjects was to count the objects as seen either from the avatar's perspective ({3PP)} or one's own perspective ({1PP).} The scene was presented either from a ground view ({GV)} or an aerial view ({AV)} to investigate the effect of view on perspective taking. The factors perspective ({3PP} vs. {1PP)} and view ({GV} vs. {AV)} were arranged in a two-factorial way. Reaction times were increased and percent correctness scores were decreased in {3PP} as opposed to {1PP.} To detect the neural mechanisms associated with perspective taking, functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed. Data were analyzed using {SPM'99} in each subject and non-parametric statistics on the group level. Activations common to {3PP} and {1PP} (relative to baseline) were observed in a network of occipital, parietal, and prefrontal areas. Deactivations common to {3PP} and {1PP} (relative to baseline) were observed predominantly in mesial (i.e., parasagittal) cortical and lateral superior temporal areas bilaterally. Differential increases of neural activity were found in mesial superior parietal and right premotor cortex during {3PP} (relative to {1PP)}, whereas differential increases during {1PP} (relative to {3PP)} were found in mesial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and superior temporal cortex bilaterally. The data suggest that in addition to joint neural mechanisms, for example, due to visuospatial processing and decision making, {3PP} and {1PP} rely on differential neural processes. Mesial cortical areas are involved in decisional processes when the spatial task is solved from one's own viewpoint, whereas egocentric operations from another person's perspective differentially draw upon cortical areas known to be involved in spatial cognition.},

For the translation trials, on the other hand, the errors and latencies when a novel point was imagined were comparable to the baseline responses from their actual point and did not vary significantly across the different imagined station points. The evidence indicates that subjects know the object-to-object relations directly, without going through the origin of a coordinate system.

If the postural disequilibrium that occurs persists beyond the time an individual is within the confines of the laboratory or system site, user safety could be compromised and products liability issues could be forthcoming. In this study, a portable, automated postural assessment system is developed that can be employed before and after exposure to a virtual reality ({VR)} system in order to certify that a user's balance on exiting the system is at least demonstrably as good as it was on entering. It is argued that if the “coming out” balance performance is sufficiently poorer than the “going in” balance, then the user should be retained until the pretest balance performance is regained. The results from a set of normative and validation experiments on postural equilibrium identified several reliable measures of stance that could serve as a basis for certification. Furthermore, a new automated video‐based measure using only head movement showed that performance over sessions is stable and reliable. The head movement changes that occur with stimuli, such as alcohol and simulator exposure, are well behaved, predictable, and significant even with small samples. The implication is that the proposed objective measure of postural stability, in conjunction with procedures for obtaining self‐reports of symptoms, can afford some measure of certification that exposure to a given {VR} system is without harm.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalography ({EEG)} biofeedback is a clinical tool to help clients alter aspects of their {EEG.} One shortcoming of traditional {EEG} biofeedback is that it only measures neural activity on the surface of the scalp. Low resolution electromagnetic tomography ({LORETA)} is an inverse solution that estimates sources of {EEG} within the cortex. {LORETA} neurofeedback is an expansion of {EEG} biofeedback implemented to train neural activity in specific cortical locations. Previous studies have found alterations in {EEG} and improved cognitive ability in healthy participants after {LORETA} neurofeedback training. However, to date no published studies on {LORETA} neurofeedback have implemented a randomized control group design.
The history of {EEG} biofeedback was reviewed, and an empirical study using {LORETA} neurofeedback with a randomized control group design was conducted. Twenty healthy participants (age 18-26; 18 male) received 10 sessions of {LORETA} neurofeedback training. Participants were assigned to one of two groups. The first group was trained to increase power in the upper alpha frequency band (10-12 Hz) in Brodmann Area 7, while participants in the second group were trained to stabilize power. Based on previous {EEG} and {fMRI} studies, it was predicted that an increase in this frequency and cortical location would result in improved spatial cognition. Upper alpha power was measured before (eyes-opened baseline), during, and after (eyes-opened baseline) each of the ten sessions. Additionally, participants completed the Mental Rotation Test and the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test before and after the training.
Results indicated that those participants who were trained to stabilize their upper alpha power actually decreased power. Participants who were trained to increase power did not increase it significantly. Changes in upper alpha power were limited to measurements during training, and did not carry over to baseline assessments. No significant between-group effects on mental rotation tests were observed. The study provides further evidence that healthy participants can gain control over their neural activity. However, the study failed to demonstrate the main premise of {LORETA} neurofeedback, which is to facilitate changes in resting {EEG} and to improve behavior.},

However, recent research on simulated viewpoint jitter provides a strong challenge to one core prediction of these theories—that increasing sensory conflict should always impair visually induced illusions of self-motion (known as vection). These studies show that jittering self-motion displays (thought to generate significant and sustained visual-vestibular conflict) actually induce superior vection to comparable non-jittering displays (thought to generate only minimal/transient sensory conflict). Here we review viewpoint jitter effects on vection, postural sway, eye-movements and motion sickness, and relate them to recent behavioural and neurophysiological findings. It is shown that jitter research provides important insights into the role that sensory interaction plays in self-motion perception.

Each class label has a disjoint set of associated hidden states, which enables efficient training and inference in our model. We evaluated our method on the task of recognizing human gestures from unsegmented video streams and performed experiments on three different datasets of head and eye gestures.

	abstract = {Abstract Spatial cognitive processes can be based on distinct reference frames centered on the body (egocentric reference frame) or centered on aspects of the surrounding environment independent of the position and orientation of the cognizing subject (allocentric reference frame). Updating of spatial information based on an egocentric reference frame is often believed to be highly automatic while the computation of spatial information based on an allocentric reference frame is assumed to be effortful and dependent on prior egocentric space processing. In this position paper I will review theoretical and empirical work that challenges the view of such a hierarchical organization of spatial reference frames and propose an embodied view of spatial reference frame computation. This perspective is based on three interdependent aspects of spatial reference frames. First, based on the existence of neural structures that allow for an automatic computation of both, egocentric and allocentric spatial representations, a functional equivalence of distinct reference frames is proposed. Second, based on the assumption of efficient computation and parallel accessibility of distinct reference frames individual proclivities are proposed to develop based on environmental and socio-cultural influences. Finally, it is proposed that ontogenetic differences are manifest in anatomical changes associated with the dominant use of different reference frames. These changes influence the microgenesis of spatial knowledge and influence behavior in other spatial cognitive tasks. In conclusion, an embodied framework of spatial reference frames strongly suggests consideration of individual reference frame proclivities to gain further insights into the complex architecture of human spatial cognition. More importantly, neuroscientific approaches describing cortical networks and associated brain dynamics have to allow participants to actively move and behave in their environment to allow for investigating the cognitive processes and brain dynamics underlying embodied spatial cognition.},

	abstract = {Mindfulness-based approaches are increasingly employed as interventions for treating a variety of psychological, psychiatric and physical problems. Such approaches include ancient Buddhist mindfulness meditations such as Vipassana and Zen meditations, modern group-based standardized meditations, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and further psychological interventions, such as dialectical behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. We review commonalities and differences of these interventions regarding philosophical background, main techniques, aims, outcomes, neurobiology and psychological mechanisms. In sum, the currently applied mindfulness-based interventions show large differences in the way mindfulness is conceptualized and practiced. The decision to consider such practices as unitary or as distinct phenomena will probably influence the direction of future research. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol 67:1-21, 2011.},

	abstract = {Human movement analysis through vision sensing systems is an important subject regarding Human-Robot interaction. This is a growing area of research, with wide range of applications fields. The ability to recognize human actions using passive sensing modalities, is a decisive factor for machine interaction. In mobile platforms, image processing is regarded as a problem, due to constant changes. We propose an approach, based on Horopter technique, to extract Regions Of Interest ({ROI)} delimiting human contours. This fact will allow tracking algorithms to provide faster and accurate responses to human feature extraction. The key features are head and both hand positions, that will be tracked within image context. Posterior to feature acquisition, they will be contextualized within a technique, Laban Movement Analysis ({LMA)} and will be used to provide sets of classifiers. The implementation of the {LMA} technique will be based on Bayesian Networks. We will use these Bayesian classifiers to label/classify human emotion within the context of expressive movements. Compared to full image tracking, results improved with the implemented approach, the horopter and consequently so did classification results.},

	abstract = {In this article we present a critique of the sensory conflict theory of motion sickness. We discuss three forms of sensory conflict that are believed to exist: input conflict, output conflict, and expectancy violation. We argue that any concept of sensory conflict necessarily entails the violation of internal expectations and, hence, that the three forms of conflict are logically identical. In the motion sickness literature, it is implicit that the expected pattern is one in which the inputs of the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems are redundant. We argue that an expectation of redundancy cannot plausibly result from interaction with the environment. We review data indicating that nonredundant patterns of intermodal stimulation lead to adaptive changes in the control of behavior; this implies that the calculation of nauseogenic conflict must be unrelated to the control of behavior. Moreover, we argue that no single pattern of sensory stimulation, redundant or otherwise, can serve as a reliable standard or expecta- tion for the calculation of sensory conflict. We conclude that there is no principled basis on which the conflict theory can distinguish between nauseogenic and nonnauseogenic situations. It follows that the concept of sensory conflict cannot provide a theoretical explanation for the existence of motion sickness. We review data suggesting an important role for the control of behavior in the etiology of motion sickness. This suggests a new basis for understanding the phenomena of motion sickness.},

Task-related electroencephalographic ({EEG)} dynamics were analyzed based on independent component analysis ({ICA)} and subsequent clustering of independent components. Parietal alpha desynchronization during encoding of spatial information predicted homing performance for participants using an egocentric reference frame. In contrast, retrosplenial and occipital alpha desynchronization during retrieval covaried with homing performance of participants using an allocentric reference frame. These results support the assumption of distinct neural networks underlying the computation of distinct reference frames and reveal a direct relationship of alpha modulation in parietal and retrosplenial areas with encoding and retrieval of spatial information for homing behavior.},

	abstract = {The vestibular system--a sensor of head accelerations--cannot detect self-motion at constant velocity and thus requires supplementary visual information. The perception of self-motion during constant velocity movement is completely dependent on visually induced vection. This can be linear vection or circular vection ({CV).} {CV} is induced by large-field visual motion stimulation during which the stationary subject perceives the moving surroundings as being stable and himself as being moved. To determine the unknown cortical visual-vestibular interaction during {CV}, we conducted a {PET} activation study on {CV} in 10 human volunteers. The {PET} images of cortical areas activated during visual motion stimulation without {CV} were compared with those with {CV.} Hitherto, {CV} was explained neurophysiologically by visual-vestibular convergence with activation of the vestibular nuclei, thalamic subnuclei and vestibular cortex. If {CV} were mediated by the vestibular cortex, one would expect that an adequate visual motion stimulus would activate both the visual and vestibular cortex. Contrary to this expectation, it was shown for the first time that visual motion stimulation with {CV} not only activates a medial parieto-occipital visual area bilaterally, separate from middle temporal/medial superior temporal areas, it also simultaneously deactivates the parieto-insular vestibular cortex. There was a positive correlation between the perceived intensity of {CV} and relative changes in regional {CBF} in parietal and occipital areas. These findings support a new functional interpretation: reciprocal inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction as a multisensory mechanism for self-motion perception. Inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction might protect visual perception of self-motion from potential vestibular mismatches caused by involuntary head accelerations during locomotion, and this would allow the dominant sensorial weight during self-motion perception to shift from one sensory modality to the other.},

The present study investigated the distribution of these navigation strategies as a function of gender, video gaming experience, and self-estimates of spatial navigation abilities in a population of 300 subjects. Participants watched videos of virtual passages through a star-field with one turn in either the horizontal (yaw) or the vertical (pitch) axis. At the end of a passage they selected one out of four homing arrows to indicate the initial starting location. To solve the task, participants could employ two discrete strategies, navigating within either an egocentric or an allocentric reference frame. The majority of valid subjects (232/260) consistently used the same strategy in more than 75\% of all trials. With that approach 33.1\% of all participants were classified as Turners (using an egocentric reference frame on both axes) and 46.5\% as Non-turners (using an allocentric reference frame on both axes). 9.2\% of all participants consistently used an egocentric reference frame in the yaw plane but an allocentric reference frame in the pitch plane (Switcher). Investigating the influence of gender on navigation strategies revealed that females predominantly used the Non-turner strategy while males used both the Turner and the Non-turner strategy with comparable probabilities. Other than expected, video gaming experience did not influence strategy use. Based on a strong quantitative basis with the sample size about an order of magnitude larger than in typical psychophysical studies these results demonstrate that most people reliably use one out of three possible navigation strategies (Turners, Non-turners, Switchers) for spatial updating and provides a sound estimate of how those strategies are distributed within the general population.},

	abstract = {Spatial cognitive processes can be based on distinct reference frames centered on the body (egocentric reference frame) or centered on aspects of the surrounding environment independent of the position and orientation of the cognizing subject (allocentric reference frame). Updating of spatial information based on an egocentric reference frame is often believed to be highly automatic while the computation of spatial information based on an allocentric reference frame is assumed to be effortful and dependent on prior egocentric space processing. In this position paper I will review theoretical and empirical work that challenges the view of such a hierarchical organization of spatial reference frames and propose an embodied view of spatial reference frame computation. This perspective is based on three interdependent aspects of spatial reference frames. First, based on the existence of neural structures that allow for an automatic computation of both, egocentric and allocentric spatial representations, a functional equivalence of distinct reference frames is proposed. Second, based on the assumption of efficient computation and parallel accessibility of distinct reference frames individual proclivities are proposed to develop based on environmental and socio-cultural influences. Finally, it is proposed that ontogenetic differences are manifest in anatomical changes associated with the dominant use of different reference frames. These changes influence the microgenesis of spatial knowledge and influence behavior in other spatial cognitive tasks. In conclusion, an embodied framework of spatial reference frames strongly suggests consideration of individual reference frame proclivities to gain further insights into the complex architecture of human spatial cognition. More importantly, neuroscientific approaches describing cortical networks and associated brain dynamics have to allow participants to actively move and behave in their environment to allow for investigating the cognitive processes and brain dynamics underlying embodied spatial cognition.},

Its innovative combination of immersive virtual reality ({VR)} and biofeedback technologies added interoceptive or inner dimensions to the already sensorially rich affordances of {VR.} Because the Meditation Chamber enabled users to become aware of autonomic senses that they are not normally conscious of, and to manipulate them in real-time, we found that it did enhance users’ abilities to learn how to meditate, particularly those who had never meditated. We describe the Meditation Chamber, scientific methods of evaluation and findings, and discuss first-person phenomenological aspects, its long-term applicability for users who have chronic pain, and future directions.},

However, the functional neural mechanisms underlying these benefits have not been thoroughly investigated. Some authors suggest that mindfulness should be described as a ‘top–down’ emotion regulation strategy, while others suggest that mindfulness should be described as a ‘bottom–up’ emotion regulation strategy. Current discrepancies might derive from the many different descriptions and applications of mindfulness. The present review aims to discuss current descriptions of mindfulness and the relationship existing between mindfulness practice and most commonly investigated emotion regulation strategies. Recent results from functional neuro-imaging studies investigating mindfulness training within the context of emotion regulation are presented. We suggest that mindfulness training is associated with ‘top–down’ emotion regulation in short-term practitioners and with ‘bottom–up’ emotion regulation in long-term practitioners. Limitations of current evidence and suggestions for future research on this topic are discussed.},

In both experiments, subjects in the head-moving condition had fewer and less severe symptoms of motion sickness and experienced illusory self-rotation after longer exposure times and at higher optokinetic velocities than in the head-stationary condition. Subjects in th- head-movement condition of the second experiment increased the frequency of their head movements as the velocity of optokinetic stimulation increased. The symptoms of motion sickness elicited during optokinetic stimulation tended to be dizziness, headache, eye-strain, and stomach awareness appearing in no fixed order.

	abstract = {Small-field optokinetic nystagmus ({OKN)} was performed in seven healthy volunteers in order to analyze the activation and deactivation patterns of visual motion, ocular motor, and multisensory vestibular cortex areas by means of {fMRI} during coherent visual motion stimulation. {BOLD} signal decreases (deactivations) were found in the first and second long insular gyri and retroinsular areas (the human homologue of the parietoinsular vestibular cortex and the visual posterior sylvian area in the monkey) of both hemispheres, extending into the transverse temporal gyrus and inferior-anterior parts of the superior temporal gyrus ({BA} 22), and the precentral gyri at two separate sites ({BA} 4 and 6). Further deactivations were found in cranioposterior parts of the superior temporal gyrus ({BA} 22) and the adjacent inferior parietal lobule ({BA} 40), anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and corpus callosum. Most of these {BOLD} signal decreases involved parts of the "multisensory vestibular cortical circuit". These findings support the concept of a reciprocally inhibitory visual–vestibular interaction that has now been demonstrated not only for large-field visual motion stimulation that induces vection (without eye movements) but also for optokinetically induced eye movements (without vection). The functional significance of this concept may be related to the perception of self-motion, since both large-field visual motion stimulation and optokinetic nystagmus are linked to the visual control of self-motion. With respect to activation of the cortical ocular motor system two separate and distinct areas of activations were delineated in the precentral sulcus of both hemispheres, one ventrolaterally (in {BA} 9) and the other dorsomedially at the junction of the superior frontal sulcus with the precentral sulcus (in {BA} 6). Both probably correspond to different subregions of the frontal eye field and the premotor cortex for the ocular motor performance of {OKN.}},

Theories of navigation focus on the role of visual and rotational body-based information, even though experimental evidence shows they are not sufficient for complex spatial tasks. To investigate the contribution of all three sources of information, we asked participants to search a computer-generated virtual room for targets. Participants were provided with only visual information or with visual information supplemented with body-based information for all movement (walk group) or rotational movement (rotate group). The walk group performed the task with near-perfect efficiency, irrespective of whether a rich or impoverished visual scene was provided. The visual-only and rotate groups were significantly less efficient and frequently searched parts of the room at least twice. These results suggest that full physical movement plays a critical role in navigational search, but only moderate visual detail is required.},

In each age group, half the children were assigned to one cognitive condition, the other half to the other condition. The results indicate that knowledge about the plausibility of a physical displacement does not affect the probability of obtaining vection. However, at both ages, the latencies for reporting vection were shorter when the physical displacement was known to be possible than when it was known to be impossible.

In the study, we equated groups differing in controllability for head movement, vision, activity, and predictability, which have often been suggested in the literature as explanations for the driver's immunity to motion sickness. Twenty-two pairs of yoked subjects were exposed to nauseogenic rotation. One subject of each pair had control over the rotation and head movements, while the other was exposed passively to the same motion stimulus. Subjects who had control reported significantly fewer motion sickness symptoms and less of a decrement in their well-being, as compared to the yoked subject without control. The results are discussed in relation to Reason's sensory rearrangement theory and the concept of feedforward mechanisms in motion perception.},

How can one fit an account of perceptual experience into a broader account of the nature of the mind and the world? -- are at the heart of metaphysics. Rather than try to cover all of the many strands in the philosophy of perception, this book focuses on a particular orthodoxy about the nature of visual {perception.The} central problem for visual science has been to explain how the brain bridges the gap between what is given to the visual system and what is actually experienced by the perceiver. The orthodox view of perception is that it is a process whereby the brain, or a dedicated subsystem of the brain, builds up representations of relevant figures of the environment on the basis of information encoded by the sensory receptors. Most adherents of the orthodox view also believe that for every conscious perceptual state of the subject, there is a particular set of neurons whose activities are sufficient for the occurrence of that state. Some of the essays in this book defend the orthodoxy; most criticize it; and some propose alternatives to it. Many of the essays are classics.

	abstract = {It has previously been shown that when a moving and a stationary display are superimposed, illusory self-rotation (circular vection) is induced only when the moving display appears as the background. Three experiments are reported on the extent to which illusory forward self-motion (forward vection) induced by a looming display is inhibited by a superimposed stationary display as a function of the size and location of the stationary display and of the depth between the stationary and looming displays. Results showed that forward vection was controlled by the display that was perceived as the background, and background stationary displays suppressed forward vection by about the same amount whatever their size and eccentricity. Also, the perception of foreground - background properties of competing displays determined which controlled forward vection, and this control was not tied to specific depth cues. The inhibitory effect of a stationary background on forward vection was, however, weaker than that found with circular vection. This difference makes sense because, for forward body motion, the image of a distant scene is virtually stationary whereas, when the body rotates, it is not.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in the understanding of spatial cognition are reviewed, focusing on memory for locations in large-scale space and on those advances inspired by single-unit recording and lesion studies in animals. Spatial memory appears to be supported by multiple parallel representations, including egocentric and allocentric representations, and those updated to accommodate self-motion. The effects of these representations can be dissociated behaviorally, developmentally, and in terms of their neural bases. It is now becoming possible to construct a mechanistic neural-level model of at least some aspects of spatial memory and imagery, with the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe providing allocentric environmental representations, the parietal lobe egocentric representations, and the retrosplenial cortex and parieto-occipital sulcus allowing both types of representation to interact. Insights from this model include a common mechanism for the construction of spatial scenes in the service of both imagery and episodic retrieval and a role for the remainder of Papez's circuit in orienting the viewpoint used. In addition, it appears that hippocampal and striatal systems process different aspects of environmental layout (boundaries and local landmarks, respectively) and do so using different learning rules (incidental learning and associative reinforcement, respectively).},

Combining this expanded framework with the measurement of multiple response variables epitomises the philosophy oftestbed evaluation. This experimental philosophy leads to a deeper understanding of the interaction and the technique(s) in question, as well as to broadly generalisable results. We also present an example experiment within this expanded framework, which evaluates the user's ability to gather information while travelling through a virtual environment. Results indicate that, of the variables tested, the complexity of the environment is by far the most important factor.},

Circular vection was governed by the motion of the display that was perceived to be the more distant, even when it was actually nearer. However, actual or perceived distance was found to be not the crucial factor in circular vection because even when the distance between the two displays was virtually zero, vection was controlled by the display perceived to be in the background.

Historically, the majority of the research on this topic has focused on interactions in the perception of stationary stimuli, but given that the majority of stimuli in the world move, an important question concerns the extent to which principles derived from stationary stimuli also apply to moving stimuli. A key finding emerging from recent work with moving stimuli is that our perception of stimulus movement in one modality is frequently, and unavoidably, modulated by the concurrent movement of stimuli in other sensory modalities. Visual motion has a particularly strong influence on the perception of auditory and tactile motion. These behavioral results are now being complemented by the results of neuroimaging studies that have pointed out the existence of both modality-specific motion-processing areas and areas involved in processing motion in more than one sense. The challenge for the future will be to develop novel experimental paradigms that can integrate behavioral and neuroscientific approaches in order to refine our understanding of multisensory contributions to the perception of movement.},

We further introduce the concept of dynamic passive haptics by which any number of virtual objects can be mapped to real physical proxy props having similar haptic properties (i. e., size, shape, and surface structure), such that the user can sense these virtual objects by touching their real world counterparts. Dynamic passive haptics provides the user with the illusion of interacting with a desired virtual object by redirecting her to the corresponding proxy prop. We describe the concepts of generic redirected walking and dynamic passive haptics and present experiments in which we have evaluated these concepts. Furthermore, we discuss implications that have been derived from a user study, and we present approaches that derive physical paths which may vary from the virtual counterparts.},

Neurobiological mechanisms of actively induced emotion regulation are associated with prefrontally mediated down-regulation of, for instance, the amygdala. We were interested in neurobiological correlates of a short mindfulness instruction during emotional arousal. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated effects of a short mindfulness intervention during the cued expectation and perception of negative and potentially negative pictures (50\% probability) in 24 healthy individuals compared to 22 controls. The mindfulness intervention was associated with increased activations in prefrontal regions during the expectation of negative and potentially negative pictures compared to controls. During the perception of negative stimuli, reduced activation was identified in regions involved in emotion processing (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus). Prefrontal and right insular activations when expecting negative pictures correlated negatively with trait mindfulness, suggesting that more mindful individuals required less regulatory resources to attenuate emotional arousal. Our findings suggest emotion regulatory effects of a short mindfulness intervention on a neurobiological level.},

Turning our eyes and head to track objects displaces the retinal image but does not affect our ability to navigate because we use extra-retinal information to compensate for these displacements. We showed observers animated displays depicting their forward motion through a scene. They perceived the simulated self-motion accurately while smoothly shifting the gaze by turning the head, but not when the same gaze shift was simulated in the display; this indicates that the visual system also uses extra-retinal information during head turns. Additional experiments compared self-motion judgments during active and passive head turns, passive rotations of the body and rotations of the body with head fixed in space. We found that accurate perception during active head turns is mediated by contributions from three extra-retinal cues: vestibular canal stimulation, neck proprioception and an efference copy of the motor command to turn the head.},

The matching performance was tested in three different conditions, which involved different information about the target position: only proprioceptive information from a ‘target’ hand which could be either the left or the right, only visual information, or both proprioceptive and visual information. Differences in matching errors between these sensory conditions suggested that dancers show better integration of local proprioceptive signals than non-dancers.

In the past, drugs have been the conventional means to alleviate pain, but in many instances, medications by themselves do not provide optimal results. Current advances are being made to control pain by integrating both the science of pain medications and the science of the human mind. Various psychological techniques, including distraction by virtual reality environments and the playing of video games, are being employed to treat pain. In virtual reality environments, an image is provided for the patient in a realistic, immersive manner devoid of distractions. This technology allows users to interact at many levels with the virtual environment, using many of their senses, and encourages them to become immersed in the virtual world they are experiencing. When immersion is high, much of the user’s attention is focused on the virtual environment, leaving little attention left to focus on other things, such as pain. In this way virtual reality provides an effective medium for reproducing and/or enhancing the distractive qualities of guided imagery for the majority of the population who cannot visualize successfully.},

	abstract = {Most virtual reality simulators have a serious flaw: Users tend to get easily lost and disoriented as they navigate. According to the prevailing opinion, this is because of the lack of actual physical motion to match the visually simulated motion: E.g., using {HMD-based} {VR}, Klatzky et al. [1] showed that participants failed to update visually simulated rotations unless they were accompanied by physical rotation of the observer, even if passive. If we use more naturalistic environments (but no salient landmarks) instead of just optic flow, would physical motion cues still be needed to prevent disorientation? To address this question, we used a paradigm inspired by Klatzky et al.: After visually displayed passive movements along curved streets in a city environment, participants were asked to point back to where they started. In half of the trials the visually displayed turns were accompanied by a matching physical rotation. Results showed that adding physical motion cues did not improve pointing performance. This suggests that physical motions might be less important to prevent disorientation if visuals are naturalistic enough. Furthermore, unexpectedly two participants consistently failed to update the visually simulated heading changes, even when they were accompanied by physical rotations. This suggests that physical motion cues do not necessarily improve spatial orientation ability in {VR} (by inducing obligatory spatial updating). These findings have noteworthy implications for the design of effective motion simulators.},

On the spatial tests, men were better than women in mental rotation skill, but men and women were similar in object location memory. In giving directions, men were more abstract and Euclidian, using miles and north–south–east–west terms, whereas women were more concrete and personal, using landmarks and left–right terms. Older subjects of both sexes gave more abstract Euclidian directions than younger subjects did. On the world map, men identified more places than women did. The data fit a causal model in which sex predicts world map knowledge and the use of Euclidian directions, both directly and indirectly through a sex difference in spatial skills. The age effect, which was independent of sex, supports a developmental view of spatial cognition.},

	abstract = {The feeling of presence in a virtual reality ({VR)} is a concept without a standardized objective measurement. In the present study, we used event-related brain potentials ({ERP)} of the electroencephalogram ({EEG)} elicited by tones, which are not related to {VR}, as an objective indicator for the presence experience within a virtual environment. Forty participants navigated through a virtual city and rated their sensation of being in the {VR} (experience of presence), while hearing frequent standard tones and infrequent deviant tones, which were irrelevant for the {VR} task. Different {ERP} components elicited by the tones were compared between participants experiencing a high level of presence and participants with a low feeling of presence in the virtual city. Early {ERP} components, which are more linked to automatic stimulus processing, showed no correlation with presence experience. In contrast, an increased presence experience was associated with decreased late negative slow wave amplitudes, which are associated with central stimulus processing and allocation of attentional resources. This result supports the assumption that increased presence is associated with a strong allocation of attentional resources to the {VR}, which leads to a decrease of attentional resources available for processing {VR-irrelevant} stimuli. Hence, {ERP} components elicited by the tones are reduced. Particularly, frontal negative slow waves turned out to be accurate predictors for presence experience. Summarizing, late {ERPs} elicited by {VR-irrelevant} tones differ as a function of presence experience in {VR} and provide a valuable method for measuring presence in {VR.} (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The experiment was designed and implemented in the context of a formal framework for the design and evaluation of {VE} travel techniques. Subjects traveled through virtual corridors, noting the location of objects along the way, and were asked to point in the direction of one of these objects when the end of the corridor was reached. Results indicate that virtual travel techniques, in which users do not physically translate their bodies, can allow the maintenance of a user's spatial orientation as measured by a pointing task. The experiment also replicates an earlier result, showing that path dimension significantly affects user performance. Finally, the strategies used by subjects to perform the task were shown to be significant, indicating that performance depends not only on the technique, environment, and task, but also on the sophistication of the user.},

Mounting evidence suggests that the neural underpinnings of multisensory integration extend into early sensory processing. This article examines the notion that neocortical operations are essentially multisensory. We first review what is known about multisensory processing in higher-order association cortices and then discuss recent anatomical and physiological findings in presumptive unimodal sensory areas. The pervasiveness of multisensory influences on all levels of cortical processing compels us to reconsider thinking about neural processing in unisensory terms. Indeed, the multisensory nature of most, possibly all, of the neocortex forces us to abandon the notion that the senses ever operate independently during real-world cognition.},

	abstract = {In two experiments, subjects traveled through virtual mazes, encountering target objects along the way. Their task was to indicate the direction to these target objects from a terminal location in the maze (from which the objects could no longer be seen). Subjects controlled their motion through the mazes using three locomotion modes. In the Walk mode, subjects walked normally in the experimental room. For each subject, body position and heading were tracked, and the tracking information was used to continuously update the visual imagery presented to the subjects on a head-mounted display. This process created the impression of immersion in the experimental maze. In the Visual Turn mode subjects moved through the environment using a joystick to control their turning. The only sensory information subjects received about rotation and translation was that provided by the computer-generated imagery. The Real Turn mode was midway between the other two modes, in that subjects physically turned in place to steer while translating in the virtual maze; thus translation through the maze was signaled only by the computer-generated imagery, whereas rotations were signaled by the imagery as well as by proprioceptive and vestibular information. The dependent measure in the experiment was the absolute error of the subject's directional estimate to each target from the terminal location. Performance in the Walk mode was significantly better than in the Visual Turn mode but other trends were not significant. A secondary finding was that the degree of motion sickness depended upon locomotion mode, with the lowest incidence occurring in the Walk mode. Both findings suggest the advisability of having subjects explore virtual environments using real rotations and translations in tasks involving spatial orientation.},

These changes, however, are associated with different patterns of structural and functional alterations in the neural network of navigation. In {AD}, these changes occur in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, parietal lobe, retrosplenial cortex, prefrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus, whereas in aging, modifications occur mainly in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. The navigation abilities of patients with mild cognitive impairment ({MCI)} have been found to show different performance patterns, depending on their cognitive profiles. Since patients with {MCI} do not uniformly develop dementia of the Alzheimer type, it is important to identify reliable early cognitive markers of conversion to {AD} dementia. In this review, we propose that navigation deficits may help distinguish patients at higher risk of developing {AD} dementia from individuals with normal cognitive aging and those with other neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Optic flow displays are frequently used both in spatial cognition/psy-chology research and {VR} simulations to avoid the influence of recognizable landmarks. However, optic flow displays not only lead to frequent misperceptions of simulated turns, but also to drastic qualitative errors: When asked to point back to the origin of locomotion after viewing simulated 2-segment excursions in {VR}, between 40\% (Riecke 2008) and 100\% (Klatzky et al., 1998) of participants responded as if they failed to update and incorporate the visually simulated turns into their responses. To further investigate such {”NonTurner”} behaviour, the current study used a wider range of path geometries that allow for clearer disambiguation of underlying strategies and mental processes. 55\% of participants showed clear qualitative pointing errors (left-right hemisphere errors), thus confirming the reliability of the effect and the difficulties in properly using optic flow even in high-quality {VR} displays. Results suggest that these qualitative errors are not caused by left-right mirrored responses, but are indeed based on a failure to properly incorporate visually presented turns into point-to-origin responses. While the majority of these qualitative errors could be attributed to {NonTurner} behaviour as previously proposed, we identified a novel, modified {NonTurner} strategy that could reconcile prior findings. Finally, results suggest that Turners (which properly incorporate visually presented turns) might use online updating of the homing direction, whereas {NonTurners} resort to more effortful and cognitively demanding offline strategies. Better understanding these strategies and underlying processes and how they depend on stimulus and display parameters can help to inform the design of more effective {VR} simulations.},

In this paper, we propose to combine health games with recommender systems. The former has a demonstrated ability in promoting behaviour change, while the latter is able to personalize user experience. This approach goes beyond traditional health games, as the recommender system’s personalization provides players with options tailored to the specific factors shaping their weight, thereby allowing for a high degree of customization which is sought after but difficult to achieve in weight interventions. Focusing on what matters for each individual can also be used to initiate dialogue with a health-care provider, which sets the stage for increased agreement on treatment and can lead to improved health outcomes.},

	abstract = {This article considers the intersensory interaction mechanisms and biomechanical aspects of human spatially oriented behavior and asks to what extent these are interrelated on earth by gravity and how they might be affected under microgravity. The interactions between vestibular, somatosensory and visual inputs for postural control are obscured by several complications (biomechanics, multi-body dynamics, multimodal feedback control, cognition etc.). However, they can be revealed in psychophysical studies on human self-motion perception. Based on such studies, we present a conceptual model, which we think is valid also for postural control. It accounts for the multi-segmental structure of the body, allowing local control of inter-segmental joints, but uses one global reference system for all segments, which is derived from the intersensory interactions. We hold that, at a sensory level, the system is tied together by linkages between vestibular, visual and somatosensory information which develop through experience of inertial and gravitational reaction forces. On earth these linkages are established even in the absence of active behavior by gravity, allowing the incorporation of one's body and its support into a notion (Gestalt) of ourselves in the environment. Under microgravity, in contrast, the linkages have to be actively established for postural and perceptual stability in the environment (e.g., by grasping a handle on the wall). From this work we recommend that future research under altered gravity conditions should be guided by models that include biomechanics, considerations of intersensory interaction and dynamic control mechanisms. Such an integrative conceptual framework will be helpful for reaching a general understanding of spatially oriented behavior.},

For Turners, rotations and translations were associated with decreased and increased (8-12 Hz) alpha activity in occipito-parietal cortex, whereas Nonturners displayed increased alpha within cortical areas along the ventral pathway, as well as in retrosplenial cortex, an area supporting bidirectional exchange of information between parietal and medial temporal regions. Both groups displayed complexity-related modulations of frontal midline (4-8 Hz) theta activity. Findings extend results of hemodynamic imaging and neuropsychological studies on spatial navigation and emphasize the need for considering individual proclivities when investigating human navigation performance.},

	url = {http://www.kyb.mpg.de/publication.html?publ=2904},
	abstract = {Despite recent technological advances, convincing self-motion simulation in Virtual Reality ({VR)} is difficult to achieve, and users often suffer from motion sickness and/or disorientation in the simulated world. Instead of trying to simulate self-motions with physical realism (as is often being done for, e.g., driving or flight simulators), we propose in this paper a perceptually oriented approach towards self-motion simulation. Following this paradigm, we performed a series of psychophysical experiments to determine essential visual, auditory, and vestibular/tactile parameters for an effective and perceptually convincing self-motion simulation. These studies are a first step towards our overall goal of achieving lean and elegant self-motion simulation in Virtual Reality ({VR)} without physically moving the observer. In a series of psychophysical experiments about the self-motion illusion (circular vection), we found that (i) vection as well as presence in the simulated environment is increased by a consistent, naturalistic visual scene when compared to a sliced, inconsistent version of the identical scene, (ii) barely noticeable marks on the projection screen can increase vection as well as presence in an unobtrusive manner, (iii) physical vibrations of the observer s seat can enhance the vection illusion, and (iv) spatialized {3D} audio cues embedded in the simulated environment increase the sensation of self-motion and presence. We conclude that providing consistent cues about self-motion to multiple sensory modalities can enhance vection, even if physical motion cues are absent. These results yield important implications for the design of lean and elegant self-motion simulators. {SUPPORT:} {EU} grant {POEMS-IST-2001-39223} (see www.poems-project.info) and Max Planck Society.},

The conditions of pathway exposure included physical walking, imagined walking from a verbal description, watching another person walk, and experiencing optic flow that simulated walking, with or without a physical turn between the path segments. If subjects failed to update an internal representation of heading, but did encode the pathway trajectory, they should have overturned by the magnitude of the turn between the path segments. Such systematic overturning was found in the description and watching conditions, but not with physical walking. Simulated optic flow was not by itself sufficient to induce spatial updating that supported correct turn responses.},

Latencies of onset are around 1 sec and short term adaptation has been shown. The dynamic range of the visual analyser as judged by frequency analysis is lower than for the vestibular analyser. Conflicting situations in which visual cues contradict vestibular and other proprioceptive cues show, in the case of linearvection a dominance of vision which supports the idea of an essential although not independent role of vision in self motion perception.},

Background: It has been suggested that a pilot’s physiological and behavioral responses during disorientation can provide a real-time model of pilot state in order to optimize performance. We investigated whether there were consistent behavioral or physiological “markers” that can be monitored during a single episode of disorientation. Methods : An Integrated Physiological Trainer with a closed loop interactive aircraft control and point of gaze/eye-tracking device was employed. There were 16 subjects proficient in maintaining straight and level flight and with procedures in changing attitude who were exposed to yaw rotation and a brief head roll to 35 ± 2°. On return to upright head position, subjects were required to initiate either an ascent or descent to a prescribed attitude. {BP}, {HR}, skin conductance, eye movements, and point of gaze were monitored throughout the onset, duration, and immediately after the disorientation insult. Simultaneously, airspeed and power settings were recorded. Results : Compared with the control condition, a significant increase (p {\textless} 0.01) in {HR}, {HR} variability, and mean arterial {BP} was observed during the disorientation. Flight performance decrement was reflected by a significant delay in setting power for attitude change and deviation in maintaining airspeed (p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusion : Changes in cardiovascular responses appear to be correlated with the onset of disorientation. The correlation of changing eye-tracking behavior and flight performance decrement is consistent with our previous findings. Further study is required to determine whether these findings can be extrapolated to repeated exposures and to other disorientation scenarios.},

	abstract = {Despite amazing advances in the visual quality of virtual environ-ments, affordable-yet-effective self-motion simulation still poses a major challenge. Using a standard psychophysical paradigm, the effectiveness of different self-motion simulations was quantified in terms of the onset latency, intensity, and convincingness of the per-ceived illusory self motion (vection). Participants were asked to actively follow different pre-defined trajectories through a naturalistic virtual scene presented on a panoramic projection screen using three different input devices: a computer mouse, a joystick, or a modified manual wheelchair. For the wheelchair, participants exerted their own minimal motion cueing using a simple force-feedback and a velocity control paradigm: small translational or rotational motions of the wheelchair (limited to 8cm and 10°, re-spectively) initiated a corresponding visual motion with the visual velocity being proportional to the wheelchair deflection (similar to a joystick). All dependent measures showed a clear enhancement of the perceived self-motion when the wheelchair was used instead of the mouse or joystick. Compared to more traditional approaches of enhancing self-motion perception (e.g., motion platforms, free walking areas, or treadmills) the current approach of using a simple user-generated motion cueing has only minimal requirements in terms of overall costs, required space, safety features, and technical effort and expertise. Thus, the current approach might be promising for a wide range of low-cost applications.},

How {PPHG} electrophysiological activity could underlie these functions, and whether they share similar timing mechanisms is unknown. We addressed this question in two intracerebral experiments which revealed that {PPHG} neural activity dissociated an early stimulus-driven effect ({\textgreater}200 and {\textless}500 ms) and a late task-related effect ({\textgreater}600 and {\textless}800 ms). Strongest {PPHG} gamma band (50–150 Hz) activities were found early when subjects passively viewed scenes (scene selectivity effect) and lately when they had to estimate the position of an object relative to the environment (allocentric effect). Based on single trial analyses, we were able to predict when patients viewed scenes (compared to other visual categories) and when they performed allocentric judgments (compared to other spatial judgments). The anatomical location corresponding to the strongest effects was in the depth of the collateral sulcus. Our findings directly affect current theories of visual scene processing and spatial orientation by providing new timing constraints and by demonstrating the existence of separable information processing stages in the functionally defined parahippocampal place area.

For the group tested, the perceived {CV} latencies were significantly shorter with fixation than without fixation in both horizontal and vertical {CV.} The effect of fixation was pronounced in subjects with longer latencies. The mean {CV} latencies for two different fixation points between the subject's eyes and the moving pattern did not differ significantly.

	abstract = {Sound fields rotating around stationary blindfolded listeners sometimes elicit auditory circular vection, the illusion that the listener is physically rotating. Experiment 1 investigated whether auditory circular vection depends on participants' situational awareness of “movability,” that is, whether they sense/know that actual motion is possible or not. While previous studies often seated participants on movable chairs to suspend the disbelief of self-motion, it has never been investigated whether this does, in fact, facilitate auditory vection. To this end, 23 blindfolded participants were seated on a hammock chair with their feet either on solid ground (“movement impossible”) or suspended (“movement possible”) while listening to individualized binaural recordings of two sound sources rotating synchronously at 60°/s. Although participants never physically moved, situational awareness of movability facilitated auditory vection. Moreover, adding slight vibrations like the ones resulting from actual chair rotation increased the frequency and intensity of vection. Experiment 2 extended these findings and showed that nonindividualized binaural recordings were as effective in inducing auditory circular vection as individualized recordings. These results have important implications both for our theoretical understanding of self-motion perception and for the applied field of self-motion simulations, where vibrations, nonindividualized binaural sound, and the cognitive/perceptual framework of movability can typically be provided at minimal cost and effort.},

	abstract = {In this work we contribute to the field of human-machine interaction with a system that anticipates human movements using the concept of Laban Movement Analysis ({LMA).} The implementation uses a Bayesian model for learning and classification and results are presented for the application to online gesture recognition. The merging of assistive robotics and socially interactive robotics has recently led to the definition of socially assistive robotics. What is necessary and we found still missing are socially interactive robots with a higher level cognitive system which analyzes deeply the observed human movement. In this article we provide a framework for cognitive processes to be implemented in human-machine-interfaces based on nowadays technologies. We present {LMA} as a concept that helps to identify useful low-level features, defines a framework of mid-level descriptors for movement-properties and helps to develop a classifier of expressive actions. Our interface anticipates a performed action observed from a stream of monocular camera images by using a Bayesian framework. With this work we define the required qualities and characteristics of future embodied agents in terms of social interaction with humans. This article searches for human qualities like anticipation and empathy and presents possible ways towards implementation in the cognitive system of a social robot. We present results through its embodiment in the social robot {'Nicole'} in the context of a person performing gestures and {'Nicole'} reacting by means of audio output and robot movement.},

	abstract = {We present as a contribution to the field of human-machine interaction a system that analyzes human movements online through multiple observers, based on the concept of Laban Movement Analysis ({LMA).} The implementation uses a Bayesian model for learning and classification, while the results are presented for the application to analyze expressive movements. In sports like Karate four judges are placed in the corners to observe the fight to ensure that the overall judgment is correct. In this paper we propose a multi-ocular system where each sub-system observes a movement from a different monocular perspective. The sub-systems send continuously guesses in form of probability distributions to the central system. The central system fuses the evidences and presents the final result. We present the Laban Movement Analysis as a concept to identify useful features of human movements to classify human actions. The movements are extracted using both, vision and magnetic tracker. The descriptor opens possibilities towards expressiveness and emotional content. To solve the problem of classification we use the Bayesian framework as it offers an intuitive approach to learning and classification. The presented work targets applications like social robots, smart houses and surveillance.},

Applications of biofeedback to different pain syndromes are discussed, as well as its effectiveness. As will be shown, although a great deal of past research has been somewhat mixed with regard to biofeedback’s ability to decrease pain, the results of this therapeutic modality are promising within the context of a more comprehensive interdisciplinary approach to pain management. As will be emphasized, with the growing popularity of the biopsychosocial approach to pain, the importance of teaching pain patients self-regulatory techniques such as biofeedback will increase as an adjuvant to other treatment modalities. The biopsychosocial model of pain, which is now accepted as the most heuristic approach to the understanding and treatment of pain disorders, views physical disorders such as pain as the result of a complex and dynamic interaction among physiologic, psychologic, and social factors, which perpetuates and may even worsen the clinical presentation. Every individual experiences pain uniquely and, therefore, treatment regimens need to be individually tailored for each patient. For many patients, biofeedback serves as an important component of this comprehensive biopsychosocial care approach.},

The purpose of the present study was to better understand and quantify the effects of visual scene variables: visual polarity and visual scene rotation on postural stability during treadmill locomotion. During 60 s trials, subjects walked at 4.0 km/h while viewing a monoscopic, passive-immersive, {3D} virtual room environment that contained either polarized or nonpolarized content and was back-projected onto a screen 1.5 m in front of them, one at a time. Scenes remained static for the first 30 s, then rotated about the roll, pitch, or yaw axis of the room at a constant rate of 30°/s for the remaining 30 s. Each subject saw each combination of visual polarity (polarized, nonpolarized) and scene rotation direction (roll, pitch, yaw) for three separate trials. There was a main effect of visual polarity on variability in torso linear X (fore–aft) position and torso roll and pitch angular orientations with polarized scenes causing more variability than nonpolarized scenes. For the polarized scenes only, variability in torso roll, pitch, and yaw angular orientations was increased for corresponding scene rotation directions, respectively. In general, rotating visual scenes caused increased variability in torso motion compared to static scenes. Visual polarity is an important consideration when designing virtual environment motion simulations.},

Voluntary suppression of {OKR} was achieved during 2–70\% of stimulus duration. Total apparent self-displacement (cumulated 90° indications) was smallest during {FOL}, increasing gradually in the order {FOL} {\textless} {STA} {\textless} {SUP} {\textless} {FIX} (all inequalities significant); {CV} latency decreased in the same order. Slow eye velocity was identical during {FOL} and {STA}, and was reduced by 70–30\% during {SUP.} We conclude from these results: (1) the effect of eye movements on {CV} depends on whether these are intentional ({FOL)} or not ({STA);} (2) the increase in {CV} during voluntary {OKR} suppression without {FP} suggests that afferent motion cues (retinal slip) are processed with larger gain than efferent motion cues (eye movement); hence (3) the enhancement of {CV} during fixation of {FP} is not, or not solely, the result of the apparent motion of the {FP} counter to the direction of pattern movement (Duncker illusion).},

	abstract = {Robust and effortless spatial orientation critically relies on "automatic and obligatory spatial updating", a largely automatized and reflex-like process that transforms our mental egocentric representation of the immediate surroundings during ego-motions. A rapid pointing paradigm was used to assess automati℅bligatory spatial updating after visually displayed upright rotations with or without concomitant physical rotations using a motion platform. Visual stimuli displaying a natural, subject-known scene proved sufficient for enabling automatic and obligatory spatial updating, irrespective of concurrent physical motions. This challenges the prevailing notion that visual cues alone are insufficient for enabling such spatial updating of rotations, and that vestibular/proprioceptive cues are both required and sufficient. Displaying optic flow devoid of landmarks during the motion and pointing phase was insufficient for enabling automatic spatial updating, but could not be entirely ignored either. Interestingly, additional physical motion cues hardly improved performance, and were insufficient for affording automatic spatial updating. The results are discussed in the context of the mental transformation hypothesis and the sensorimotor interference hypothesis, which associates difficulties in imagined perspective switches to interference between the sensorimotor and cognitive (to-be-imagined) perspective.},

	title = {Redirected walking},
	abstract = {There are many different techniques for allowing users to specify locomotion in human-scale, immersive virtual environments. These include flying with a hand-controller, using a treadmill, walking-in-place, and others. Real walking, where the user actually and physically walks in the lab, and virtually moves the same distance and in the same direction in the virtual scene, is better than flying. It is more input-natural, does not require learning a new interface, results in a greater sense of presence, and theoretically results in less simulator sickness. One serious problem with real walking, however, is that the size of the virtual scene is limited by the size of tracked area. For example, for an architect to really walk in a virtual prototype of a house, the tracked area must be as large as the house. This requirement makes real walking infeasible for many facilities and virtual scenes. To address this limitation, I have developed Redirected Walking, which by interactively and imperceptibly rotating the virtual scene around her, makes the user turn herself. Under the right conditions, Redirected Walking would cause the user to unknowingly walk in circles in the lab, while thinking she is walking in a straight and infinitely long path in the virtual scene. In this dissertation I develop Redirection, discuss its theoretical and physiological underpinnings, and presents results to show that it can be used: (1) to make the user turn themselves, (2) without causing the user to be aware of Redirection, (3) without unacceptably increasing the user's level of simulator sickness and, most importantly, (4) to useful effect: (A) In head-mounted display systems, the user can experience a virtual scene larger than the lab while also having the benefits of real walking. (B) In an open-backed, three-walled {CAVE}, users can have the increased presence and input-naturalness normally associated with a fully enclosed {CAVE.} I also present guidelines for {VE} practitioners wishing to use Redirection, based on the theory and observations reported in this dissertation.},

Perceived velocity increased linearly with both angular speed and spatial frequency. The spatial frequency effect was independent of the relative angular width of light and dark stripes and was also found to apply to the case of a single moving bar. Evidence for weighted frequency averaging was obtained for more complex patterns. The results are consistent with a model involving both a spatial frequency dependent input mediated by temporal frequency and an angular speed input relating to the movement of a single edge through the visual field.
Es wurde der Einfluβ räumlicher Frequenz eines horizontal bewegten Musters vertikaler Schwarz-Weiβbalken auf der wahrgenommenen Geschwindigkeit untersucht. Die wahrgenommene Geschwindigkeit steigt mit zunehmender Reizmustergeschyindigkeit und räumlicher Frequenz linear an. Der Einfluβ der räumlichen Frequenz ist unabhängig vom Gröβenverhältnis der Schwarz- und Weiβbalkenbreiten zueinander; bei einem Einzelbalken wird die Geschwindigkeit entsprechend durch die Balkenbreite bestimmt. Bei komplexen Mustern findet eine gewichtete Frequenzmittlung statt. Die Ergebnisse sprechen für ein Modell, das sowohl räumliche Frequenzüber die Messung der zeitlichen Frequenzen an einem Retinaort als auch die Winkelgeschwindigkeit des Reizes berücksichtigt.},

In 7 experiments, 116 college students were tested, with closed eyes, at stationary running or at walking to a previewed target after adaptation, with closed eyes, to treadmill locomotion. Subjects showed faster inadvertent drift during stationary running and increased distance (overshoot) when walking to a target. Overshoot seemed to saturate (i.e., reach a ceiling) at 17\% after as little as 1 min of adaptation. Sidestepping at test reduced overshoot, suggesting motor specificity. But inadvertent drift effects were decreased if the eyes were open and the treadmill was drawn through the environment during adaptation, indicating that these effects involve self-motion perception. Differences in expression of inadvertent drift and of overshoot after adaptation to treadmill locomotion may have been due to different sets of ancillary cues available for the 2 tasks. Self-motion perception is multimodal. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2013 {APA}, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

	abstract = {We studied the degree of dependence on vision, for postural control and for perception, among male adult dancers and untrained subjects. First, body sways were analyzed on a free seesaw platform. Fast Fourier transform processing allowed spectral frequency analysis of the platform sways recorded by an accelerometer. Secondly, a visual dependence test, the rod and frame test ({RFT)} was used. Professional dancers were significantly more stable and less dependent on vision for postural control and for perception than untrained subjects. Presumably, professional dance training strengthens the accuracy of proprioceptive inputs and shifts sensorimotor dominance from vision to proprioception. For the dancers, there was interaction between the {RFT} visual dependence and the visual control of posture: the less visual-dependent they were for the {RFT}, the more stable they were in dynamic balance conditions.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce first steps towards a logically consistent framework describing and relating items concerning the phenomena of spatial orientation processes, namely spatial presence, spatial updating, piloting, and spatial cognition. Spatial presence can for this purpose be seen as the consistent feeling of being in a specific spatial context, and intuitively knowing where one is with respect to the immediate surround. The core idea of the framework is to model spatial orientation-related issues by analyzing their logical and functional relations. This is done by determining necessary and/or sufficient conditions between related items like spatial presence, spatial orientation, and spatial updating. This eventually leads to a set of necessary prerequisites and sufficient conditions for those items. More specifically, the logical structure of our framework suggests novel ways of quantifying spatial presence and spatial updating. Furthermore, it allows to disambiguate between two complementing types of automatic spatial updating: On the one hand, the well-known continuous spatial updating induced by continuous movement information. On the other hand, a novel type of discontinuous, teleport-like “instantaneous spatial updating” that allows participants to quickly adopt the reference frame of a new location without any explicit motion cues.},

Correlations between maze performance and traditional psychometric measures of spatial ability also were examined. Male and female subjects completed a total of five learning trials on each of two spatial mazes and completed a battery of spatial and verbal cognitive tests. As well as demonstrating the typical male advantage on psychometric measures of spatial performance, robust sex differences favoring males were found for both the time required to solve the mazes (d = 1.59) and the number of spatial memory errors committed ( d = 1.40). Highly significant positive correlations were obtained between scores on the paper and pencil tests and performance on the maze task. The results of the present study are consistent with results from studies in other mammalian species suggesting a male advantage for spatial navigation through a novel environment.},

Is the visual system more sensitive to linear whole-field accelerations than are inertial systems? This would be surprising because the visual system is regarded as being much less sensitive to local acceleration signals than to local velocity signals (e.g., Eagle, 1996). We measured discrimination thresholds ({JNDs)} for peak velocity and for peak acceleration using immersive whole-field visual signals for linear motion (in an {HMD)} as well as non-visual whole-body inertial experiences (on a motorized cart). In both modalities, motion stimuli were developed in which peak acceleration and peak velocity were decoupled. The initial acceleration profiles in each case were roughly Gaussian, while the resulting velocity profiles were S-shaped. Acceleration duration was varied between 1 and 1.5 seconds, so that peak velocity could not be used to substitute for peak acceleration, nor could acceleration substitute for velocity without precise temporal integration. In a 2 X 2 design, stimuli were either visual (virtual hallway presented in a 60 deg {FOV} {HMD)} or inertial (on a computer-controlled cart), and judgments were either of peak velocity or peak acceleration. Observers made comparisons to an internal standard, with feedback. Despite the feedback, observers in the inertial experiments confounded velocity with acceleration, and {JNDs} for peak velocity discrimination from inertial senses were about 10\% of the standard, whereas {JNDs} for peak acceleration were about 5\%. Conversely {JNDs} for peak visual velocity were about 5\% of the standard, while those for acceleration were about 10\%. Evidently, visual superiority is limited to the perception of velocity. Visual and vestibular sensitivities may be complementary in perceiving accelerative and non-accelerative phases of self-motion.},

	abstract = {Previous research on visually induced self-motion found that stimulation of the central visual field (up to 30° in diameter) results in perceived object motion, while self-motion requires peripheral stimulation. The present study examined the importance of area of stimulation in the central field using a radially expanding dot pattern simulating a 3-dimensional structure translating along the line of sight. In Exp I, with 48 undergraduates, perceived self-motion was induced with this radially expanding pattern, with visual angles of 7.5°, 10.6°, 15°, and 21.2°. Speed and texture density were also varied. The duration of reported self-motion (a) decreased with increased speed, (b) failed to increase with increased visual angle, and (c) decreased with visual angle at the highest speed level. In Exp {II}, 36 Ss rated the perceived depth of the displays. The speed and speed/area interaction effects on judged depth matched those found for induced self-motion. Results suggest an extension of the focal/ambient theory. In addition to a more primitive ambient processing mode that requires peripheral vision, there is a higher level system concerned with ambient processing that functions in the central visual field and uses more complex stimulus information such as internal depth represented in a radially expanding pattern.

Moreover, we use virtual reality technology to build {3D} scenery that provides navigation clues in an environment with no visual reference frame. Using the virtual environment, we confirm that {TENS} lessens spatial disorientation. Across subjects and sessions, the parietal component of brain activity exhibited baseline elevation predominantly in the theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) band as the subjects navigated. This study also found that subjects performed better after {TENS} in terms of behavioral and {EEG} data.

We are plagued by a growing variety of personal and social discontents generated by deceptive body images. This book argues that improved body consciousness can relieve these problems and enhance one's knowledge, performance, and pleasure. The body is our basic medium of perception and action, but focused attention to its feelings and movements has long been criticized as a damaging distraction that also ethically corrupts through self-absorption. In Body Consciousness, Richard Shusterman refutes such charges by engaging the most influential twentieth-century somatic philosophers and incorporating insights from both Western and Asian disciplines of body-mind awareness. Rather than rehashing intractable ontological debates on the mind-body relation, Shusterman reorients study of this crucial nexus toward a more fruitful, pragmatic direction that reinforces important but neglected connections between philosophy of mind, ethics, politics, and the pervasive aesthetic dimensions of everyday life."--Jacket.},
