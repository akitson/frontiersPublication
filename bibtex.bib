abstract = {Sex differences in spatial ability are widely acknowledged, yet considerable dispute surrounds the magnitude, nature, and age of first occurrence of these differences. This article focuses on 3 questions about sex differences in spatial ability: What is the magnitude of sex differences in spatial ability? On which aspects of spatial ability are sex differences found? and When, in the life span, are sex differences in spatial ability first detected? Implications for clarifying the linkage between sex differences in spatial ability and other differences between males and females are discussed. We use meta-analysis, a method for synthesizing empirical studies, to investigate these questions. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that sex differences arise on some types of spatial ability but not others, that large sex differences are found only on measures of mental rotation, that smaller sex differences are found on measures of spatial perception, and that, when sex differences are found, they can be detected across the life span.},

The present study examined these issues in the context of spatial abilities. A meta-analysis of 286 effect sizes from a variety of spatial ability measures was conducted. Effect sizes were partitioned by the specific test used and by a number of variables related to the experimental procedure in order to achieve homogeneity. Results showed that sex differences are significant in several tests but that some intertest differences exist. Partial support was found for the notion that the magnitude of sex differences has decreased in recent years. Finally, it was found that the age of emergence of sex differences depends on the test used. Results are discussed with regard to their implications for the study of sex differences in spatial abilities.},

abstract = {As people move through an environment, they typically change both their heading and their location relative to the surrounds. During such changes, people update their changing orientations with respect to surrounding objects. People can also update after only imagining such typical movements, but not as quickly or accurately as after actual movement. In the present study, blindfolded subjects pointed to objects after real and imagined walks. The role of rotational and translational components of movement were contrasted. The difficulty of imagined updating was found to be due to imagined rotation and not to imagined translation; updating after the latter was just as quick and accurate as updating after actual rotations and translations. Implications for understanding primary spatial orientation, the organization of spatial knowledge, and spatial-imagination processes are discussed.},

abstract = {This essay presents and discusses the state of the art in studies of desert ant (Cataglyphis) navigation. In dealing with behavioural performances, neural mechanisms, and ecological functions these studies ultimately aim at an evolutionary understanding of the insect's navigational toolkit: its skylight (polarization) compass, its path integrator, its view-dependent ways of recognizing places and following landmark routes, and its strategies of flexibly interlinking these modes of navigation to generate amazingly rich behavioural outputs. The general message is that Cataglyphis uses path integration as an egocentric guideline to acquire continually updated spatial information about places and routes. Hence, it relies on procedural knowledge, and largely context-dependent retrieval of such knowledge, rather than on all-embracing geocentred representations of space.},

abstract = {The present study investigated the brain dynamics accompanying spatial navigation based on distinct reference frames. Participants preferentially using an allocentric or an egocentric reference frame navigated through virtual tunnels and reported their homing direction at the end of each trial based on their spatial representation of the passage. Task-related electroencephalographic (EEG) dynamics were analyzed based on independent component analysis (ICA) and subsequent clustering of independent components. Parietal alpha desynchronization during encoding of spatial information predicted homing performance for participants using an egocentric reference frame. In contrast, retrosplenial and occipital alpha desynchronization during retrieval covaried with homing performance of participants using an allocentric reference frame. These results support the assumption of distinct neural networks underlying the computation of distinct reference frames and reveal a direct relationship of alpha modulation in parietal and retrosplenial areas with encoding and retrieval of spatial information for homing behavior.},

abstract = {The present study examines the functional and anatomical underpinnings of egocentric and allocentric coding of spatial coordinates. For this purpose, we set up a functional magnet resonance imaging experiment using verbal descriptions of spatial relations either with respect to the listener (egocentric) or without any body-centered relations (allocentric) to induce the two different spatial coding strategies. We aimed to identify and distinguish the neuroanatomical correlates of egocentric and allocentric spatial coding without any possible influences by visual stimulation. Results from sixteen participants show a general involvement of a bilateral fronto-parietal network associated with spatial information processing. Furthermore, the egocentric and allocentric conditions gave rise to activations in primary visual areas in both hemispheres. Moreover, data show separate neural circuits mediating different spatial coding strategies. While egocentric spatial coding mainly recruits the precuneus, allocentric coding of space activates a network comprising the right superior and inferior parietal lobe and the ventrolateral occipito-temporal cortex bilaterally. Furthermore, bilateral hippocampal involvement was observed during allocentric, but not during egocentric spatial processing. Our results demonstrate that the processing of egocentric spatial relations is mediated by medial superior-posterior areas, whereas allocentric spatial coding requires an additional involvement of right parietal cortex, the ventral visual stream and the hippocampal formation. These data suggest that a hierarchically organized processing system exists in which the egocentric spatial coding requires only a subsystem of the processing resources of the allocentric condition.},

@article{Wiener2011,
abstract = {Path integration is a fundamental mechanism of spatial navigation. In non-human species, it is assumed to be an online process in which a homing vector is updated continuously during an outward journey. In contrast, human path integration has been conceptualized as a configural process in which travelers store working memory representations of path segments, with the computation of a homing vector only occurring when required. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we tested whether humans can employ different path integration strategies in the same task. Using a triangle completion paradigm, participants were instructed either to continuously update the start position during locomotion (continuous strategy) or to remember the shape of the outbound path and to calculate home vectors on basis of this representation (configural strategy). While overall homing accuracy was superior in the configural condition, participants were quicker to respond during continuous updating, strongly suggesting that homing vectors were computed online. Corroborating these findings, we observed reliable differences in head orientation during the outbound path: when participants applied the continuous updating strategy, the head deviated significantly from straight ahead in direction of the start place, which can be interpreted as a continuous motor expression of the homing vector. Head orientation-a novel online measure for path integration-can thus inform about the underlying updating mechanism already during locomotion. In addition to demonstrating that humans can employ different cognitive strategies during path integration, our two-systems view helps to resolve recent controversies regarding the role of the medial temporal lobe in human path integration.},

@article{Vidal2004,
abstract = {Spatial navigation in the presence of gravity restricts one's displacement to two-dimensional (2D) planes. Therefore, self-motion only includes translations and yaw rotations. In contrast, in weightlessness, one can translate and turn in any direction. In the first experiment, we compared the ability to memorize a virtual three-dimensional (3D) maze after passive exploration in three self-motion conditions, each using a different set of rotations for turning. Subjects indicated which pathway they traversed among four successive corridors presented from an outside perspective. Results showed that exploring in the terrestrial condition (including only yaw rotations, the viewer's virtual body remaining upright) allowed better recognition of the corridor than in the weightless condition (which included pitch and yaw rotations according to the turns), particularly for more complex 3D structures. The more frequently the viewer-defined (egocentric) and the global environment (allocentric) verticals were aligned during exploration, the more easily subjects could memorize the 3D maze, suggesting that simplifying the relationship between the egocentric and allocentric reference frames facilitates spatial updating. Nevertheless, with practice, performance in the weightless condition improved whereas in the natural terrestrial condition performance remained at its initial maximum, indicating that the cognitive processes involved were innate for this particular condition. The second experiment revealed that single rotations in the terrestrial condition must be performed around the body axis in order to obtain optimal spatial updating performance, and that the latter is independent of the conflict with gravity that might favor this condition when one is actually upright. This suggests that although humans can memorize 3D-structured environments their innate neurocognitive functions appear to be specialized for natural 2D navigation.},

We recorded the EEG signal of a traverse through a virtual tunnel to search for the best signal features that discriminate between specific strategies in particular plane. We identified intrahemispheric coherences in occipital-parietal and temporal-parietal areas as the most discriminative features. They have 10\% lower error rate compared to single electrode features adopted in previous studies. The behavioral analysis revealed that 11\% of participants switched from egocentric to allocentric strategy in a vertical plane, while 24\% of participants consistently adopted egocentric strategy in both planes.},

They confused the direction of tunnel turns more frequently and made less accurate judgments about the location of the end position. Errors in map drawing suggest that the impairment may be linked to deficits in updating cognitive heading in the absence of corresponding perceptual information from the virtual environment.},

These signals are combined using a specific gain mechanism that enables the different coordinate frames of the various input signals to be combined into common, distributed spatial representations. These distributed representations can be used to convert the sensory locations of stimuli into the appropriate motor coordinates required for making directed movements. Within these spatial representations of the posterior parietal cortex are neural activities related to higher cognitive functions, including attention. We review recent studies showing that the encoding of intentions to make movements is also among the cognitive functions of this area.},

abstract = {Neuropsychological studies of patients with lesions of right frontal (premotor) or posterior parietal cortex often show severe impairments of attentive sensorimotor behavior. Such patients frequently manifest symptoms like hemispatial neglect or extinction. Interestingly, these behavioral deficits occur across different sensory modalities and are often organized in head- or body-centered coordinates. These neuropsychological data provide evidence for the existence of a network of polymodal areas in (primate) premotor and inferior parietal cortex representing visual spatial information in a nonretinocentric frame of reference. In the monkey, a highly modular structural and functional specialization has been demonstrated especially within posterior parietal cortex. One such functionally specialized area is the ventral intraparietal area (VIP). This area is located in the fundus of the intraparietal sulcus and contains many neurons that show polymodal directionally selective discharges, i.e., these neurons respond to moving visual, tactile, vestibular, or auditory stimuli. Many of these neurons also encode sensory information from different modalities in a common, probably head-centered, frame of reference. Functional imaging data on humans reveal a network of cortical areas that respond to polymodal stimuli conveying motion information. One of these regions of activation is located in the depth of human intraparietal sulcus. Accordingly, it is suggested that this area constitutes the human equivalent of monkey area VIP. The functional role of area VIP for polymodal spatial perception in normals as well as the functional implications of lesions of area VIP in parietal patients needs to be established in further experiments.},

abstract = {Spatial judgments and actions are often based on multiple cues. The authors review a multitude of phenomena on the integration of spatial cues in diverse species to consider how nearly optimally animals combine the cues. Under the banner of Bayesian perception, cues are sometimes combined and weighted in a near optimal fashion. In other instances when cues are combined, how optimal the integration is might be unclear. Only 1 cue may be relied on, or cues may seem to compete with one another. The authors attempt to bring some order to the diversity by taking into account the subjective discrepancy in the dictates of multiple cues. When cues are too discrepant, it may be best to rely on 1 cue source. When cues are not too discrepant, it may be advantageous to combine cues. Such a dual principle provides an extended Bayesian framework for understanding the functional reasons for the integration of spatial cues.},

abstract = {Research in spatial navigation revealed the existence of discrete strategies defined by the use of distinct reference frames during virtual path integration. The present study investigated the distribution of these navigation strategies as a function of gender, video gaming experience, and self-estimates of spatial navigation abilities in a population of 300 subjects. Participants watched videos of virtual passages through a star-field with one turn in either the horizontal (yaw) or the vertical (pitch) axis. At the end of a passage they selected one out of four homing arrows to indicate the initial starting location. To solve the task, participants could employ two discrete strategies, navigating within either an egocentric or an allocentric reference frame. The majority of valid subjects (232/260) consistently used the same strategy in more than 75\% of all trials. With that approach 33.1\% of all participants were classified as Turners (using an egocentric reference frame on both axes) and 46.5\% as Non-turners (using an allocentric reference frame on both axes). 9.2\% of all participants consistently used an egocentric reference frame in the yaw plane but an allocentric reference frame in the pitch plane (Switcher). Investigating the influence of gender on navigation strategies revealed that females predominantly used the Non-turner strategy while males used both the Turner and the Non-turner strategy with comparable probabilities. Other than expected, video gaming experience did not influence strategy use. Based on a strong quantitative basis with the sample size about an order of magnitude larger than in typical psychophysical studies these results demonstrate that most people reliably use one out of three possible navigation strategies (Turners, Non-turners, Switchers) for spatial updating and provides a sound estimate of how those strategies are distributed within the general population.},

abstract = {Following body rotation, optimal updating of the position of a memorized target is attained when retinal error is perceived and corrective saccade is performed. Thus, it appears that these processes may enable the calibration of the vestibular system by facilitating the sharing of information between both reference frames. Here, it is assessed whether having sensory information regarding body rotation in the target reference frame could enhance an individual's learning rate to predict the position of an earth-fixed target. During rotation, participants had to respond when they felt their body midline had crossed the position of the target and received knowledge of result. During practice blocks, for two groups, visual cues were displayed in the same reference frame of the target, whereas a third group relied on vestibular information (vestibular-only group) to predict the location of the target. Participants, unaware of the role of the visual cues (visual cues group), learned to predict the location of the target and spatial error decreased from 16.2 to 2.0°, reflecting a learning rate of 34.08 trials (determined from fitting a falling exponential model). In contrast, the group aware of the role of the visual cues (explicit visual cues group) showed a faster learning rate (i.e. 2.66 trials) but similar final spatial error 2.9°. For the vestibular-only group, similar accuracy was achieved (final spatial error of 2.3°), but their learning rate was much slower (i.e. 43.29 trials). Transferring to the Post-test (no visual cues and no knowledge of result) increased the spatial error of the explicit visual cues group (9.5°), but it did not change the performance of the vestibular group (1.2°). Overall, these results imply that cognition assists the brain in processing the sensory information within the target reference frame.},

Theories of navigation focus on the role of visual and rotational body-based information, even though experimental evidence shows they are not sufficient for complex spatial tasks. To investigate the contribution of all three sources of information, we asked participants to search a computer-generated virtual room for targets. Participants were provided with only visual information or with visual information supplemented with body-based information for all movement (walk group) or rotational movement (rotate group). The walk group performed the task with near-perfect efficiency, irrespective of whether a rich or impoverished visual scene was provided. The visual-only and rotate groups were significantly less efficient and frequently searched parts of the room at least twice. These results suggest that full physical movement plays a critical role in navigational search, but only moderate visual detail is required.},

@article{Riecke2004,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: When we move through the environment, the self-to-surround relations constantly change. Nevertheless, we perceive the world as stable. A process that is critical to this perceived stability is "spatial updating", which automatically updates our egocentric mental spatial representation of the surround according to our current self-motion. According to the prevailing opinion, vestibular and proprioceptive cues are absolutely required for spatial updating. Here, we challenge this notion by varying visual and vestibular contributions independently in a high-fidelity VR setup. METHODS: In a learning phase, participants learned the positions of twelve targets attached to the walls of a 5x5m room. In the testing phase, participants saw either the real room or a photo-realistic copy presented via a head-mounted display (HMD). Vestibular cues were applied using a motion platform. Participants' task was to point "as accurately and quickly as possible" to four targets announced consecutively via headphones after rotations around the vertical axis into different positions. RESULTS: Automatic spatial updating was observed whenever useful visual information was available: Paticipants had no problem mentally updating their orientation in space, irrespective of turning angle. Performance, quantified as response time, configuration error, and pointing error, was best in the real world condition. However, when the field of view was limited via cardboard blinders to match that of the HMD (40 30), performance decreased and was comparable to the HMD condition. Presenting turning information only visually (through the HMD) hardly altered those results. In both the real world and HMD conditions, spatial updating was obligatory in the sense that it was significantly more difficult to ignore ego-turns (i.e., "point as if not having turned") than to update them as usual. CONCLUSION: The rapid pointing paradigm proved to be a useful tool for quantifying spatial updating. We conclude that, at least for the limited turning angles used (<60), the Virtual Reality simulation of ego-rotation was as effective and convincing (i.e., hard to ignore) as its real world counterpart, even when only visual information was presented. This has relevant implications for the design of motion simulators for, e.g., architecture walkthroughs.},

abstract = {When moving through space, we continuously update our egocentric mental spatial representation of our surroundings. We call this seemingly effortless, automatic, and obligatory (i.e., hard-to-suppress) process "spatial updating". Our goal here is twofold: (1) To quantify spatial updating; (2) Investigate the importance and interaction of visual and vestibular cues for spatial updating. In a learning phase (20 min) subjects learned the positions of twelve targets attached to the walls, 2.5m away. Subjects saw either the real environment or a photo-realistic copy presented via a head-mounted display (HMD). A motion platform was used for vestibular stimulation. In the test phase subjects were rotated to different orientations and asked to point "as quickly and accurately as possible" to four targets announced consecutively via headphones. In general, subjects had no problem mentally updating their orientation in space and were as good as for rotations where they were immediately returned to the original orientation. Performance, quantified as response time, absolute pointing error and pointing variability, was best in the real world condition. However, when the field of view was limited via cardboard blinders to match that of the HMD (40x30 deg), performance decreased and was comparable to the HMD condition. Presenting turning information only visually (through the HMD) hardly altered those results. In both the real world and HMD conditions, spatial updating was obligatory in the sense that it was significantly more difficult to IGNORE ego-turns (i.e., "point as if not having turned") than to UPDATE them as usual. Speeded pointing tasks proved to be a viable method for quantifying "spatial updating". We conclude that, at least for the limited turning angles used (<60 deg), the Virtual Reality simulation of ego-rotation was as effective and convincing (i.e., hard to ignore) as its real world counterpart, even when only visual information was presented.

In the updating condition, replicating research of J. J. Rieser (1989), response latencies were only slightly affected by the magnitude of the body rotation. In the ignoring condition, however, response latencies increased with the angular difference between the participants' new position and their original orientation, suggesting that the participants updated their positions and then retrospectively "undid" this updating to mentally reestablish their original orientation. The results are supportive of the idea that heading is updated automatically as a person moves so that she or he is always primarily oriented with respect to her or his actual position.},

abstract = {The control and perception of body orientation and motion are subserved by multiple sensory and motor mechanisms ranging from relatively simple, peripheral mechanisms to complex ones involving the highest levels of cognitive function and sensory-motor integration. Vestibular contributions to body orientation and to spatial localization of auditory and visual stimuli have long been recognized. These contributions are reviewed here along with new insights relating to sensory-motor calibration of the body gained from space flight, parabolic flight, and artificial gravity environments. Recently recognized contributions of proprioceptive and somatosensory signals to the appreciation of body orientation and configuration are described. New techniques for stabilizing posture by means of haptic touch and for studying and modeling postural mechanisms are reviewed. Path integration, place cells, and head direction cells are described along with implications for using immersive virtual environments for training geographic spatial knowledge of real environments.},

@article{Frissen2011,
abstract = {Spatial updating during self-motion typically involves the appropriate integration of both visual and non-visual cues, including vestibular and proprioceptive information. Here, we investigated how human observers combine these two non-visual cues during full-stride curvilinear walking. To obtain a continuous, real-time estimate of perceived position, observers were asked to continuously point toward a previously viewed target in the absence of vision. They did so while moving on a large circular treadmill under various movement conditions. Two conditions were designed to evaluate spatial updating when information was largely limited to either proprioceptive information (walking in place) or vestibular information (passive movement). A third condition evaluated updating when both sources of information were available (walking through space) and were either congruent or in conflict. During both the passive movement condition and while walking through space, the pattern of pointing behavior demonstrated evidence of accurate egocentric updating. In contrast, when walking in place, perceived self-motion was underestimated and participants always adjusted the pointer at a constant rate, irrespective of changes in the rate at which the participant moved relative to the target. The results are discussed in relation to the maximum likelihood estimation model of sensory integration. They show that when the two cues were congruent, estimates were combined, such that the variance of the adjustments was generally reduced. Results also suggest that when conflicts were introduced between the vestibular and proprioceptive cues, spatial updating was based on a weighted average of the two inputs.},

@article{Riecke2007a,
abstract = {Robust and effortless spatial orientation critically relies on "automatic and obligatory spatial updating", a largely automatized and reflex-like process that transforms our mental egocentric representation of the immediate surroundings during ego-motions. A rapid pointing paradigm was used to assess automatic/obligatory spatial updating after visually displayed upright rotations with or without concomitant physical rotations using a motion platform. Visual stimuli displaying a natural, subject-known scene proved sufficient for enabling automatic and obligatory spatial updating, irrespective of concurrent physical motions. This challenges the prevailing notion that visual cues alone are insufficient for enabling such spatial updating of rotations, and that vestibular/proprioceptive cues are both required and sufficient. Displaying optic flow devoid of landmarks during the motion and pointing phase was insufficient for enabling automatic spatial updating, but could not be entirely ignored either. Interestingly, additional physical motion cues hardly improved performance, and were insufficient for affording automatic spatial updating. The results are discussed in the context of the mental transformation hypothesis and the sensorimotor interference hypothesis, which associates difficulties in imagined perspective switches to interference between the sensorimotor and cognitive (to-be-imagined) perspective.},

abstract = {Three experiments investigated whether the systematic errors previously observed in a triangle-completion task were caused by failures to form and update a cognitive heading or by use of perceived heading (even though an updated cognitive heading was available) during the response. These errors were replicated when participants indicated the origin of triangular paths they had imagined walking by turning their bodies toward the origin, but not when they responded verbally. The results indicate that participants are capable of updating their cognitive heading using imagined movements and suggest that the systematic errors previously observed were a result of the strong attachment of responses such as turns to a perceptual representation of the physical body.},

abstract = {Maintaining spatial orientation while travelling requires integrating spatial information encountered from an egocentric viewpoint with accumulated information represented within egocentric and/or allocentric reference frames. Here, we report changes in high-density EEG activity during a virtual tunnel passage task in which subjects respond to a postnavigation homing challenge in distinctly different ways--either compatible with a continued experience of the virtual environment from a solely egocentric perspective or as if also maintaining their original entrance orientation, indicating use of a parallel allocentric reference frame. By spatially filtering the EEG data using independent component analysis, we found that these two equal subject subgroups exhibited differences in EEG power spectral modulation during tunnel passages in only a few cortical areas. During tunnel turns, stronger alpha blocking occurred only in or near right primary visual cortex of subjects whose homing responses were compatible with continued use of an egocentric reference frame. In contrast, approaching and during tunnel turns, subjects who responded in a way compatible with use of an allocentric reference frame exhibited stronger alpha blocking of occipito-temporal, bilateral inferior parietal, and retrosplenial cortical areas, all areas implicated by hemodynamic imaging and neuropsychological observation in construction and maintenance of an allocentric reference frame. We conclude that in these subjects, stronger activation of retrosplenial and related cortical areas during turns support a continuous translation of egocentrically experienced visual flow into an allocentric model of their virtual position and movement.},

abstract = {Three experiments investigated spatial orientation in a virtual navigation task. Subjects had to adjust a homing vector indicating their end position relative to the origin of the path. It was demonstrated that sparse visual flow was sufficient for accurate path integration. Moreover, subjects were found to prefer a distinct egocentric or allocentric reference frame to solve the task. "Turners" reacted as if they had taken on the new orientation during turns of the path by mentally rotating their sagittal axis (egocentric frame). "Nonturners," by contrast, tracked the new orientation without adopting it (allocentric frame). When instructed to use their nonpreferred reference frame, both groups displayed no decline in response accuracy relative to their preferred frame; even when presented with reaction formats based on either ego or allocentric coordinates, with format unpredictable on a trial, both groups responded highly accurately. These findings support the assumption of coexisting spatial representations during navigation.},

abstract = {In many mammalian species, it is known that males and females differ in place learning ability. The performance by men and women is commonly reported to also differ, despite a large amount of variability and ambiguity in measuring spatial abilities. In the non-human literature, the gold standard for measuring place learning ability in mammals is the Morris water task. This task requires subjects to use the spatial arrangement of cues outside of a circular pool to swim to a hidden goal platform located in a fixed location. We used a computerized version of the Morris water task to assess whether this task will generalize into the human domain and to examine whether sex differences exist in this domain of topographical learning and memory. Across three separate experiments, varying in attempts to maximize spatial performance, we consistently found males navigate to the hidden platform better than females across a variety of measures. The effect sizes of these differences are some of the largest ever reported and are robust and replicable across experiments. These results are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of the virtual Morris water task for humans and show a robust sex difference in virtual place learning.},

abstract = {More than three decades of research have demonstrated a role for hippocampal place cells in representation of the spatial environment in the brain. New studies have shown that place cells are part of a broader circuit for dynamic representation of self-location. A key component of this network is the entorhinal grid cells, which, by virtue of their tessellating firing fields, may provide the elements of a path integration-based neural map. Here we review how place cells and grid cells may form the basis for quantitative spatiotemporal representation of places, routes, and associated experiences during behavior and in memory. Because these cell types have some of the most conspicuous behavioral correlates among neurons in nonsensory cortical systems, and because their spatial firing structure reflects computations internally in the system, studies of entorhinal-hippocampal representations may offer considerable insight into general principles of cortical network dynamics.},
